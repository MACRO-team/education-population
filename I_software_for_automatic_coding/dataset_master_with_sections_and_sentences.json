The scaffolding is tailored to the student’s needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed.

Furthermore, little is known about how digital technologies that are increasingly being used in these informal environments can enhance learning. Through a quasi-experimental design, this study compared four conditions for learning science in a science museum using augmented reality and knowledge-building scaffolds known to be successful in formal classrooms. Results indicated that students demonstrated greater cognitive gains when scaffolds were used. Through the use of digital augmentations, the study also provided information about how such technologies impact learning in informal environments.",

In an attempt to mitigate the research complexities associated with informal science learning, the study focused on students who visit the museum as part of a school field trip. They represent a key segment of the informal science learning population. Every science museum depends significantly on them and devotes extensive energy and resources to serving their needs. While on their field trip, students encounter science exhibits in small chaperone-based groups of, typically, six to nine children. For this study, we used the chaperone-based small group model as our participant paradigm. Students from grades six, seven, and eight participated in the study. We recruited teachers to bring their students who had previously participated in workshops and other teacher events at the museum or were referred to us to participate in the study by those teachers. All of the participating student groups came from a high needs urban school district with an average of 92 % of students qualifying for free or reduced price lunch. In total, 119 students participated, with a gender ratio of 55 % female to 45 % male. Because the study addressed the topic of electrical conductivity, middle grade students were selected as they would have encountered this topic in their classrooms by grade 6 (as dictated by the local standardized curriculum). This provided a common ground for the participants, ensuring similar prior knowledge. On the day before the trip, we went to the school and administered a conceptual knowledge survey, described below. The teacher had no access to the survey questions so as to control for potential interference. On the day of the field trip, the students traveled with their teacher and chaperones by bus to the museum and were greeted for orientation. As is the norm for school field trips, the students had approximately 4 h to spend at the museum before they needed to be back on their buses for the return to school. Approximately 25– 30 min of that time was spent participating in this research study. The rest of the time was free for them to explore the museum. As mentioned above, the typical chaperoned field trip model applied, with each chaperone instructed to bring a sub-group to the research area at a specified time. Upon arrival and orientation, one group proceeded immediately to participate in the study while everyone else went to explore the exhibits, knowing when they should return to the research area. While in the research area, each student interacted with the device as part of a group of three, but otherwise had no exposure to what other students in the class were doing.",

Results indicated that the immersive-world dyad and immersive-world single user conditions performed signiﬁ- cantly better than the electronic textbook group on stan- dardized items. The immersive-world dyad condition also performed signiﬁcantly better than either the expository textbook or the descriptive framing condition on a perfor- mance-based transfer task, and performed signiﬁcantly better than the expository textbook condition on standardized test items. Implications for science education, and consistent with the goals of this special issue, are that immersive game- based learning environments provide a powerful new form of curriculum for teaching and learning science.",

Simply put, the expository text condition the information was presented in a manner similar to most school textbooks. Increasing the amount of content contextualization, the simplistic framing (SF) condition involved one rich story- line in which all the content was situated—what the Cog- nition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (1993) referred to as a macrocontext. While learning was narratively connected in this condition in terms of an overarching the 3rd person description storyline or problem-based learning context, students read mostly descriptive text about the storyline and their choices had no impact on the unfolding of the story. This condition while hypertext in design, was similar to a book, and was not intended to establish any sense of virtual presence but simply position the work in a manner similar to word problems. In the perceptually rich IW condition, we designed a virtual environment where students had to navigate an avatar in a virtual park to interview non-player characters and collect water quality data (see Fig. 1).

A  study  comparing  the  effectiveness  of  the ‘construct-by-self’,  ‘construct-on-scaffold’,  and  ‘construct  by  paper-and- pencil’  concept  mapping  showed  that  the  ‘construct-on-scaffold’  had better  effect  for  learning  on  biology.

TAs use simple artificial intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of responsibility toward improving their agents’ knowledge. We describe, in detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured by the curriculum’s accompanying tests. The TA also helped children learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests. The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of reasoning, specifically by means of TA software.",

It has not yet been addressed whether pedagogical agents have a similar impact in more open learning environments that aim at fostering students’ acquisition of complex problem solving skills. To fill this gap, this study compares two experimental conditions to a control condition. In the first experimental condition, the pedagogical agent’s inter- ventions are adapted to students’ activities (APA-group). In the second experimental group, the agent interferes on fixed time intervals (NPA-group). Students work on an environmental problem in an open learning environment. It was hypothesized that the two experimental groups would outperform the control group and, additionally, that the APA-group would outperform the NPA-group. Results show that the NPA-group outperforms the control group, and that the APA-group takes a middle position, not differing from either the NPA-group or the control-group. Consequently, the second hypothesis was not confirmed. An agent providing adapted advice did not result in better performance. The discussion provides some possible explanations for these results.",

A  fourth,  No-tutor  condition  offers  no step-by-step  problem  solving  support. The  immediate feedback  group  with  greatest  tutor  control  of  problem solving yielded the most efficient learning.   These students completed the tutor problems fastest, and the three tutor- tests. supported  groups  performed  equivalently  on Questionnaires revealed little student preference among the four conditions.

Participants and environment The physics education technology simulations The Physics Education Technology (cid:1)PhET(cid:2) project at the University of Colorado has developed a suite of physics simulations that take advantage of the opportunities of com- puters while addressing some of the limiting concerns of these tools.15 The PhET project has developed approximately 50 simulations that span the curriculum of introductory phys- ics and are freely available online.16 These simulations are designed to be highly interactive, engaging, and open learn- ing environments that provide animated feedback to the user. The simulations model physically accurate, highly visual, dynamic representations of physics principles. Simulta- neously, the simulations are designed to build explicit bridges between students’ everyday understanding of the world and its underlying physical principles, often by mak- ing these physical models (cid:1)such as current ﬂow or electric ﬁeld lines(cid:2) visible. For instance, a student learning about electromagnetic radiation starts with a radio station transmit- ter and antenna at a nearby house. Students can drive an electron to oscillate at the transmission station, then observe the propagation of the electric ﬁeld and the resulting motion of an electron at the receiving antenna. A variety of virtual observation and measurement tools are provided to encour- age students to explore properties of this microworld.17 Each simulation is tested with multiple student interviews before being user tested in class and out of class. Knowledge gained from these evaluations is iteratively used to improve the next generation of simulations. More on the PhET project and the research methods used to develop the simulations is avail- able in Ref. 16. The Circuit Construction Kit (cid:1)CCK(cid:2) simulates the behav- ior of simple electric circuits and provides an open work- space where students can manipulate resistors, light bulbs, wires, and batteries (cid:1)Fig. 1(cid:2).

The course was the second semester of a two-semester sequence covering electricity, magnetism, optics, and mod- ern physics. Students, typically in their second or third year of study, received ﬁve credit hours for participating in three lectures and one integrated two-hour laboratory and recita- tion section per week. Weekly homework assignments were the traditional end-of-chapter style questions, presented and graded by a computer system Computer Assisted Personal- ized Approach (cid:1)CAPA(cid:2).22 Two instructors and seven teaching assistants (cid:1)TAs(cid:2) were assigned to the 363 students enrolled in this 15-week course. The laboratories occurred every other week, alternating with the recitation sections. Six laboratory sessions were of- fered over the course of the term. The authors had recently revised the laboratories in order to emphasize an inquiry- based approach. The labs stressed discovery rather than veriﬁcation3,23,24 and included some elements of “Scientiﬁc Community Labs.”25 This study was conducted in the second laboratory of the course, dc circuits. Students engaged in a series of exercises including examining resistors in series and parallel, building a simple circuit and then predicting, ob- serving and reconciling its behavior as various elements (cid:1)re- sistors or light bulbs(cid:2) were added or rearranged, and ﬁnally developing methods to measure resistance in multiple ways in these circuits. The goals of the laboratory were for stu- dents to develop an understanding of simple circuits (cid:1)the concepts of voltage, current, and series, parallel, and equiva- lent resistance(cid:2), to develop the skills associated with con- necting light bulbs, resistors, and wires in various combina- tions, and to collect data and make arguments about these circuits’ behaviors. Each laboratory began with students turn- ing in prelaboratory work and asking TAs questions about the material.",

Critical stance is an aspect of self-regulated learning that emphasizes the need to evaluate the truth and relevance of information as the learner engages in systematic inquiry to answer challenging questions. The Web tutor is called SEEK, an acronym for Source, Evidence, Explanation, and Knowledge. The SEEK Tutor was designed to promote a critical stance through several facilities in a computer environment: spoken hints on a mock Google™ search page, on-line ratings on the reliability of particular Web sites, and a structured note-taking facility that prompted them to reflect on the quality of particular Web sites. We conducted two experiments that trained students how to take a critical stance and that tracked their behavior while exploring Web pages on plate tectonics to research the causes of the volcanic eruption of Mt. St. Helens. The SEEK Tutor did improve critical stance, as manifested in essays on the causes of the volcanic eruption, and did yield learning gains for some categories of information (compared with comparison conditions). However, many measures were unaffected by either the presence of the SEEK Tutor or by prior training on critical stance. We anticipate that robust improvements on critical stance and learning will require more training and/or some expert feedback and interactive scaffolding of critical stance in the context of specific examples.",

To the extent that the SEEK Tutor is effective, there should be better performance in the SEEK Tutor condition than the Navigation condition. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that substantially more training is needed before learners can effectively plan, monitor, and strategically apply a critical stance to science learning, even if they are supported in those behaviours by a Web tutor.",

Moreover, these questions serve to model the kinds of questions students need to be asking themselves to further their understanding.

Although virtual learning environments provide mobile agents as a platform for services to learners, one type of mobile agent only serves in one course, bringing possible beneﬁts to users. This study was conducted to use agent techniques to construct a ubiquitous teaching assistant (u-TA) for assisting students solve problems in laboratory courses. We gave the u-TA enhanced social skills so that it can reduce the burden on teachers. The proposed u-TA system consists of both Web-based and instant messenger-based (IM-based) interfaces, and the u-TA can learn from other agents by analyzing their dialogues. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the u-TA and the results show that the u-TA can assist students and share the TA’s workload in courses. The experimental results also demonstrated that the u-TA has good communications ability; its two user interfaces can increase interactions with students.

        "abstract": " Abstract Within the context of an introductory CS1 unit on algorithmic problem-solving, we are exploring the pedagogical value of a novel active learning activity—the ‘‘studio experience’’—that actively engages learners with algorithm visualization technology. In a studio experience, student pairs are tasked with (a) developing a solution to an algorithm design problem, (b) constructing an accompanying visualization with a storyline, and ﬁnally (c) presenting that visualization for feedback and discussion in a session modeled after an architectural ‘‘design crit.’’ Is a studio experience educationally valuable? What kind of technology can best support it? To explore these questions, we conducted an empirical study of two altern- ative CS1 studio experiences in which students used one of two diﬀerent kinds of algorithm development and visualization technology: (a) a text editor coupled with art supplies, or (b) ALVIS Live!, a computer-based algorithm development and visualization tool. We found that the students who used ALVIS Live! developed algorithms with signiﬁcantly fewer seman- tic errors. Moreover, discussions mediated by ALVIS Live! had signiﬁcantly more student audience contributions, and retained a sharper focus on the speciﬁc details of algorithm behavior, leading to the collaborative identiﬁcation and repair of semantic errors. In addition, discussions mediated by both ALVIS Live! and art supplies contained substantial evidence of higher order thinking. Based on our results, we make recommendations for educators interested in exploring studio- based approaches, and we propose an agenda for future research into studio-based learning in computer science education.

In this oﬀering of the course, we observed a total of 41 stu- dents, who were split across two studio diﬀerent studio experience sessions. In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these sessions as the Art Supply sessions, because students in these sessions used art supplies to construct their visualizations. Note that, in contrast, the Spring, 2005 oﬀering of CptS 121 initially enrolled 124 students, of whom 67 ultimately completed the course with a passing grade (a 45% attrition rate). In this oﬀering of the course, we observed 38 students, who, once again, were split across two diﬀerent studio expe- rience sessions. Henceforth, we will refer to these sessions as the ALVIS sessions, because students in these sessions used the ALVIS Live! programming and visualization environment (Hundhausen & Brown, 2005b) to construct their visualizations. The students who participated in the Art Supply sessions we observed were predominantly male (91.1%), with an average age of 21.7 (SD = 2.5). Similarly, the students who participated in the ALVIS sessions we observed were predominantly male (92.0%), with a mean age of 21.9 years (SD = 2.3). The students in both the Art Supply and ALVIS sessions varied greatly with respect to their previous programming experience. Roughly 40–50% of the students came in to the course with no prior programming experience. The remaining 50–60% of the students had at least some programming experience, either in a high school course, or on their own. C.D. Hundhausen, J.L. Brown / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 301–326",

This project is grounded in research on online education as well as theory and research around self-regulated learning in both online and offline contexts. This research is conducted through Michigan Virtual School's (MVS) learning management system (LMS) over two academic terms in six high school mathematics courses. Participating students (N=69) completed the pre-survey consisting of the PISA Student Characteristics Questionnaire (Artelt, Baumert, Julius-McElvany, & Peschar, 2003), a self-regulated learning assessment (Cleary and Zimmerman, 2004) and an online learning readiness assessment (Roblyer & Davis, 2008). Following the pre-survey participants were be randomly assigned to one of three conditions (experimental, control I, control II) and received either self-regulatory, general interventions (in the form of videos, journals, and short surveys), or no interventions--respective of condition. Research questions were as follows: 1) can computer mediated contexts be designed to fully facilitate and support adolescents’ use of self- regulated learning processes in learning; 2) does the presence of SRL scaffolding in online K-12 courses lead to gains in adolescent learners' a) self-efficacy and motivation or b) individual and environmental control, do a. and b. vary across dimensions of preparedness; 3) does the presence of SRL scaffolding lead to greater a) domain knowledge? b) student retention in online K-12 courses; 4) how does SRL scaffolding influence adolescent learners’ ability to successfully regulate their learning to produce improved student achievement outcomes in computer mediated contexts?

Critical to the success of this project has been a client-centered design approach that has  matched  our  client's  expertise  in  curricular  objectives  and  classroom teaching  with  our  expertise  in  artificial  intelligence  and  cognitive psychology.    The  Pittsburgh  Urban  Mathematics  Project  (PUMP)  has produced an algebra curriculum that is centrally focused on mathematical analysis of real world situations and the use  of  computational  tools.    We have  built  an  intelligent  tutor,  called  PAT,  that  supports  this  curriculum and  has  been  made  a  regular  part  of  9th  grade  Algebra  in  3  Pittsburgh schools.  In the 1993-94 school year, we evaluated the effect of the PUMP curriculum  and  PAT  tutor  use.    On  average  the  470  students  in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on  standardized  tests  and  100%  on  tests  targeting  the  PUMP  objectives. This study provides further evidence that laboratory tutoring  systems  can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools.",

In this paper we investigate the role of reflection in simulation based learning by manipulating two independent factors that each separately lead to significant learning effects, namely whether students worked alone or in pairs, and what type of support students were provided with.  Our finding is that in our simulation based  learning  task,  students  learned  significantly  more  when  they  worked  in  pairs  than  when  they  worked alone.   Furthermore,  dynamic  support  implemented  with  tutorial  dialogue  agents  lead  to  significantly  more learning than no support, while static support was not statistically distinguishable from either of the other two conditions.  The largest effect size in comparison with the control condition was Pairs+Dynamic support, with an effect size of 1.24 standard deviations, where the control condition is individuals working alone with no support. Because the effect size achieved by combining the two treatments is greater than the effect achieved by  either  of  the  two  treatments  alone,  we  conjecture  that  each  of  these  factors  are  contributing  something different to student learning rather than being potential replacements for one another.",

They were enrolled in a first- year introductory programming unit, in which Java was used as the teaching language. A vast majority of them were international students hailing from upper-middle-class families in the In- dian subcontinent, with medium levels of household income. Most of the participants were en- rolled in a Graduate Diploma of Information Technology or Master of Information Technology program, having completed an undergraduate degree in a different discipline in their home coun- try. International students enrolled in these degree programs generally apply to the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Citizenship for permission to work, and upon being granted this permission are allowed to do so for maximum of 20 hours per week during the aca- demic semester (Department of Immigration and Citizenship, n. d.). The study took place in Weeks 3, 4, and 5 of a 12-week semester. At this point in the semester, the students had undergone an orientation to BlueJ, which included creating a project as well as adding a provided class to the project and compiling it. They had also been introduced to the theoretical concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods, had exposure to the purpose and format of Java API documentation, and learned how to instantiate classes and invoke instance methods using BlueJ’s GUI interface. Although in Week 4 they attended a lecture introducing basic Java code for instantiation and instance method invocation, they had not had hands-on prac- tice in writing code themselves. In all, 38 students participated in the study, 36 males and 2 females. The participants in each tuto- rial class were randomly allocated to the 4 groups: 8 were allocated to the S0B0 group, 10 were allocated to the S0B1 group, 9 were allocated to the S1B0 group, and 11 were allocated to the S1B1 group. (S0B0 and S1B1 contained one female participant each.) The slightly unequal group sizes were due to the lack of attendance of a small number of students. Learning Tasks and Procedure During the Week 3 lab class, all students were asked to complete a set of exercises, which re- quired them to complete a set of tasks in BlueJ, based on a plain English description (English => BlueJ). These tasks involved using BlueJ’s GUI interface to instantiate unseen, provided classes and invoke methods on the instances interactively. The students had access to the API documen- tation for the provided classes while completing the exercises. Solutions to the exercises were provided to allow them to check their work. The solutions were presented as screencasts demon- strating the actions that needed to be performed in BlueJ to accomplish the required tasks. Most of the screencasts lasted no more than one minute each. The main data collection was carried out during the Week 5 lab class. Students were not notified of the exercise in advance, in order to minimize the possibility of certain participants undertaking additional study in their own time that would give them an advantage over other participants, the- reby confounding the results. This class began with a 30-minute “chalk and talk” session review- ing how to write Java code to perform instantiation and instance method invocation, as well as how to refer to API documentation to facilitate such tasks. This session incorporated a demonstra- tion in which the instructor used a sample BlueJ project to model the process of implementing a",

The basic idea behind scaffolding is to provide a temporary and adjustable support to help learners accomplish a task that is beyond their capability and to allow them to do as much as they can on their own (Bruner,  1978; Wood, Bruner, & Ross,  1976).  Research has shown that scaffolding can be a highly effective instructional strategy through the use of human tutors (e.g., Wood, 1980), as well as in the context of computer-based learning systems (e.g., Jackson, Stratford, Krajcik, & Soloway,  1995).  In either context, contingency is one of the most important features of scaffolding.  Good scaffolding is dynamically adjustable to meet learners’ cognitive needs.",

The second study had a sample of 24 fifth-grade children and their parents from several schools in a large metropolitan area in Canada.  It was found that scaffolding and contingent tutoring indices were positively associated with children’s improvements in long-division skills, from pretest to posttest, and were also related to an independent rating of tutoring effectiveness. Pratt (1998) expanded his studies with Savoy-Levine on contingent tutoring of long-division skills with fourth and fifth graders.  The same nine levels of support were used in both of their studies.  However, they controlled more fully several aspects of the storing patterns utilized in order to isolate the effects of the contingent principle more systematically and to examine the generalizability of children’s learning from such tutoring within their ZPD.  They were also interested in the affective implications of different types of scaffolding procedures designed for children.  Wood (1980) informally observed that preschoolers that had been instructed based on contingent shift principles seemed to have more positive attitudes toward their tutors than children instructed in other ways, and were, perhaps, more willing to engage in further learning sessions with R eproduced  with  permission  of the  copyright  owner.

This situation may make students feel disorientated while attempting image searching. This study thus designed an image navigation tool, location-based hierarchical navigation support (LHINS), which can dynamically construct a compact WordNet-based hierarchy augmented by location. Using this tool, learners can assimilate new information based on their existing knowledge structure, thus avoiding cognitive overload so as to scaffold their metacognitive skills. Sixty-four high school students were invited to take part in an experiment to test the efﬁcacy of the proposed tool compared to a normal keyword-based search (NKBS) system. The experiment evaluated not only the students’ task completion time in the NKBS and LHINS groups, but also their keyword reformulation process, in order to determine the differences in their metacognitive skills. The results revealed that the LHINS group tended to complete the tasks faster and develop better metacognitive skills related to keyword refor- mulation as compared to the NKBS group. This ﬁnding suggests that an image search engine, enhanced by a compact hierarchical navigation tool, can help learners develop better search strategies. When examining how learners with different cognitive styles used the tool, the results showed that learner performance depends on cognitive style, as well as the image retrieval system used, and thus a more detailed investigation of the interaction between the",

Aims and objectives of this study The LHINS system aims to assist students by providing navigational support as they work to retrieve animal images. The ﬁrst objective of this study is thus to examine the effec- tiveness of the LHINS system by comparing it with a normal keyword-based search (NKBS) approach. Despite only providing a single search ﬁeld for queries and displaying results in a grid-based format, NKBS was seen by the subjects as relatively simple to use because it was more familiar to the students. The students’ search behavior was measured by both the average amount of time needed to complete a task and the semantic relatedness between a sequence of search queries and the target terms. The former measurement indicates the students’ overall search performance (Tu et al. 2008), while the latter is intended to further show the students’ metacognitive skill as it relates to keyword refor- mulation in order to represent it in a comparable way.

This study examined two types of model progression as means to compensate for these skill deﬁciencies. Model order progression (MOP), the predicted optimal variant, gradually increases the speciﬁcity of the relations between variables, whereas model elaboration progression (MEP) gradually expands the number of variables in the task. The study utilized a between-subject design with three conditions: a MOP condition (n ¼ 28), a MEP condition (n ¼ 26), and a control condition without model progression (n ¼ 30). Consistent with expectations, model progression enhanced students’ task performance; a comparison among the two model progression conditions conﬁrmed the predicted superiority of the MOP condition. These results are discussed in relation to the inconsistent ﬁndings from prior research. Based on this discussion ways to optimize model order progression are advanced. (cid:1) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "participants": " participants who worked with the complete version of the program. Research on combining a training-wheels system with other support has produced mixed results. Carroll and Carrithers (1984; experiment 2) demonstrated that training-wheels have added value to an instructional manual: learners working with an instructional manual in a simpliﬁed version of the domain performed faster and more successful compared to learners working with a manual in the full-complex domain. Results further showed that the training-wheels reduced learners’ time spent recovering from errors, which most likely accounts for the instructional efﬁcacy of the training-wheels system (cf. Lazonder & van der Meij, 1995). However, Spannagel, Girwids, Lo¨the, Zendler, and Schroeder (2008) found that learning to use a spreadsheet program with animated instruc- tions, predominantly led to better performance than learning with text manuals, and that a training-wheels interface did not yield better results for students who learned with animations. In a more recent study, Lo¨hner et al. (2003) replicated the training-wheels ﬁndings in the domain of modelling the temperature inside a house. They compared the performance of a textual modelling group and a graphical modelling group. Participants in the textual modelling group had to build a full- complex model by specifying the relations between variables in precise, quantitative form. Participants in the graphical modelling group, in contrast, only had to indicate whether relations were positive or negative (i.e., specifying the rela- tions qualitatively); the underlying mathematical speciﬁca- tions of the relations were handled by the system. Students using the graphical representation were found to switch quickly from one relation to the next, and try every idea that came up, which might be a viable strategy for the initial stages of a modelling process. Lo¨hner et al. therefore concluded that at the beginning of an inquiry process, novice learners beneﬁt from building qualitatively speciﬁed models compared to building quantitative models. Although these studies demonstrate that starting off in a simple form can be beneﬁcial to learning, they did not take the progression to higher levels of complexity into consider- ation. Supportive evidence on this matter can be found in the literature on learning with simulations. In a study by Alessi (1995), model progression pertained to the ﬁdelity of the simulation; the general idea behind this form of progression was to go from ‘simpliﬁed’ to more ‘realistic’ simulations. Alessi assumed that ﬁdelity progression would enhance learning because a simpliﬁed simulation supposedly facilitates initial learning whereas high ﬁdelity is expected to be better from a transfer point of view. To validate this claim, three learned procedural knowledge groups were compared that about how to use a multimeter either with a low-ﬁdelity simulation, ﬁdelity progression simulations, or a high-ﬁdelity simulation. The results conﬁrmed some of Alessi’s expecta- tions: even though the three groups did not differ on measures of learning while working with the simulations, the high ﬁdelity and progression simulations were found to enhance performance on a transfer task, thus supporting the notion that high ﬁdelity simulations are superior in transfer. More recently, Zacharia and Olympiou (2011) were unable to replicate these ﬁndings. Participants who progressed from experimenting with a simulation to experimenting with the real equipment were found to learn as much as those who experimented with the real equipment only. However, partic- ipants who only worked with the simulation performed as well as participants in the other two conditions. Other studies investigated model elaboration progression. Rieber and Parmley (1995) compared performance of students who were presented with either a structured or an unstructured simulation regarding the physics principles of Newtonian mechanics. The structured simulation consisted of a series of four activities in which students were given increasing levels of control over a simulated, free-ﬂoating object. This simu- lation was considered ‘structured’ because each activity included a controlled number of new subskills, and each successive activity incorporated the subskills of the preceding activity. The unstructured simulation consisted of an open- ended and unstructured activity in which subjects assumed full control over the ﬂoating object from the very beginning. Results indicated that students in the structured condition outperformed students in the unstructured condition.",

It aimed to create a learning environment that fosters knowledge building discourse through working with multiple concept-specific representations. Three hundred and eighty-nine students and twenty-four tutors from different tutorial classes in Queensland, Australia participated in the study. Students were randomly allocated to two experimental groups and a comparison group. In the experimental groups, pairs of students used the interactive simulation to explore action potential. Only one of the experimental groups received instruction that modelled the scientific and visual language conventions of the representations within the simulation. In the comparison group, small groups of students used a traditional paper- based activity. Students across all groups were audio recorded using a think-aloud protocol while completing the group activity. Individual learning gains in the experimental groups and the comparison group were similar. However, the experimental groups showed a significantly greater included explanatory answers, evaluations, interpretation, testing and synthesis compared to the comparison group, indicating a deeper understanding of action potential. Analysis of misconceptions on the post-test and tutors’ reflections revealed that the experimental group receiving instruction modelling the scientific and visual language conventions around the representations had a better grasp of the terminology associated with the concepts compared with the other groups. The findings suggest that instruction focussing on the language conventions of concept-specific representations fosters the development of disciplinary discourse by transforming students’ social practices of working with scientific knowledge.",

Studies have shown that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics.

A non- equivalent pretest–posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the IMMPA EC Lab on students’ understanding and motivation in the learning of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study.

        "participants": " Participants The study involved two, parallel third grade classes (ages 9–10 years) at a school in southern Sweden. One class (n = 24, of which 13 girls and 11 boys) was assigned to play the math game during regular math lessons for 9 weeks (henceforth referred to as the game-playing group), whereas the other class (n = 23, of which 13 girls and 10 boys) followed the regular curriculum during the same period (the control group). Splitting conditions at the level of class was due to school policy and practical reasons for enabling a long-term in-class study. Because the two participating classes belonged to the same school, they used the same textbooks and had the same homework policy. The students had similar ethnographic backgrounds in terms of home environment, parents’ educational level and socio-economic status. Over the intervention period of 9 weeks, both groups received a comparable amount of base-ten instruction (covered as a central topic in the curriculum and textbooks for this period of time). Both groups also completed identical national math tests, to which much attention is paid during this period, since the results constitute the basis for nationwide quality comparisons. Therefore, apart from the game intervention, math activities during the study were as equivalent as possible between conditions. Collaborative activities, where students work in pairs or small groups, were part of the regular math lessons and appeared in some sections of the national math tests. Both groups were subject to a pedagogical strategy called ‘‘Ask three’’, in which students were to consult three other students before asking the teacher how to solve a problem. We emphasize that the only systematic difference of learning material and general teaching methods between condi- tions during the intervention period was that the game-playing group played the math game whereas the control group continued their regular math classes. A few students in the control group were aware of the fact that students in the other group were playing a game, however they seemed satisﬁed with the information that they too, eventually, would get the opportunity to play the game (i.e. after the intervention period of the study). One conspicuous factor that differed between the two conditions was their respective class teachers. It is well established that teachers play a prominent role in students’ learning. Especially for a subject such as mathematics, which relatively many students ﬁnd difﬁcult or not enjoyable, a teacher’s competence as well as apparent enthusiasm for the subject can most certainly affect the students’ learning process (Lafortune and Pons 2005). In addition, it appeared over the course of our study that the teacher of the control group took more interest in her subject and appeared more enthusiastic than the teacher of the game-playing group. This posed a potential problem for the study, as it might be difﬁcult to distinguish between motivational inﬂuences of the game and the teacher respectively.",

Two computer-based interactive games for engineering statics are described in this study. These games are designed to foster proﬁciency and conﬁdence in narrowly deﬁned but essential topics through the use of repetition and carefully constructed levels of difﬁculty. The game format provides students with a learning structure and an incentive to develop skills at their own pace in a non- judgmental but competitive and often fun environment. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of both games revealed that: (a) students’ quantitative ratings and comments were consistently positive; (b) students who used the games scored signiﬁcantly higher on quizzes over the subject material than those who learned via traditional lecture; and (c) students rated the games as signiﬁcantly more effective than the textbook as an aid for learning the material.

CoMPASS is a hypertext system that presents students with external, graphical representations in the form of concept maps as well as textual representations both of which change dynamically as students traverse through the domain and make navigational decisions. In a study in which middle school students used CoMPASS, we analyzed students’ navigation paths as well as their learning outcomes. A comparison class in which students used the system without the maps for navigation provided us with information about students’ use of the maps for navigation and its effect on their learning. We found that students who used the maps version of the system performed significantly better in a concept mapping test as well as an essay test and their navigation was more focused.

The proportion  of  goal-related  concepts  that  students  in  the  maps-class  visited  was  greater than that of the index-class; however the proportion of goal related concepts decreased as the  tasks  became  more  open-ended.  This  may  have  been  because  students  explored  the domain a bit more when they had to figure out what concepts were relevant.

Students who worked with ECCM provided more informed recommendations by using supporting evidence from the available resources and discussing alternative points of view on the topic. The findings showed a significantly positive relationship between student recommendation score and the ability to develop ECCM.

The rationale for using this beginning nursing course as a setting for the research study stems from the idea that improving nurse’s ill-structured problem-solving and metacognitive skills should begin at the earliest stages of their nursing education. Data Collection Techniques and Procedures All participants read problem cases, one per week, for four weeks and completed a problem solution report for each one. Participants were asked to complete a self-reflection at the end of the study processes after the last case report had been filed. Of the 68 participants, 65 completed all four of the problem cases and 58 completed the self-reflection report. From the last grouping, 6 participants also participated in the” think-aloud protocols” for each of the four cases. To complete the problem solution reports the participants were asked to read the problem case and then do the following: (a) define the problem, (b) propose solutions, (c) provide evidence for their solutions, and (d) evaluate the solutions. The participants’ responses to these case reports comprised part of the data used to answer the research question. The problem cases were accessed using the learning management system (LMS) during their regular scheduled class time. The participants typed in their responses to the problem cases during the class time in a text box displayed on the screen below each of the cases. During the baseline and final problem case, scaffolding was not provided for any of the participants. In problem Case 1 and Case 2, the participants from the experimental groups received scaffolding in the form of question prompts or by listening to alternative perspectives via an online link. The control group did not have access to these types of support. Participants submitted their answers through the LMS once they had completed the assignment. After the problem solution reports were submitted, the course instructor printed a copy of each participant’s problem solution report, removed identifying information and then assigned it a number code. The same number code was used for each participant throughout the study. The course instructor then gave the solution reports to the researcher. The six participants (two from each section of the course) who participated in the think-aloud protocols were videoed in a separate room during each of the problem cases. The verbalizations of the participants from each group who participated in the think-aloud protocols were transcribed into a word document by the researcher. The word document was then used to analyze the thinking process of the participants as they worked through the problem-solving cases.",

        "participants": " Participants who used the frustration control tools in Professor Sudoku were able to complete puzzles at higher game levels by monitoring the degrees of correctness of their current paths and associated potential for success. Fast feedback discouraged players from spending too much time on wrong paths, but also reduced the potential for inducing rules via trial-and-error learning, which should not be avoided simply because it increases the potential for frustration. Prensky (2001) has discussed this issue in terms of “failure tolerance,” which is a major feature of game worlds. During our experiment, we observed that students in the frustration control group relied heavily on the error check tooldin other words, they were reluctant to accept any risk of failure. Their overreliance on system prompts blocked them from internalizing knowledge acquired from interaction with the game system. Students in this group also did not use available critical feature- marking tools to develop problem-solving strategies. Other scaffolds, such as the demonstration scaffold in Professor Sudoku, offer hints or suggestions for guiding players through a process of “ﬁnding the correct solution.” It is clear how easily this type of scaffold can undermine learning if overused, but most players acknowledge that overreliance on these tools can make a game boring and success meaningless. Striking a balance between the two must be a central goal of educational game design efforts. The more that students view an educational game as entertaining, the more they will control their use of scaffolds in order to maintain a sense of playfulness. Scaffolds such as the critical feature-making tool in Professor Sudoku systematically present visualized game statistics. This can be very helpful for reducing cognitive load. As digital games become increasingly complex, it is hard for players/learners to understand all aspects of a game or to ﬁnd correct solution paths entirely on their own; therefore, there is little need to discourage the use of this type of scaffolding tool. When games are speciﬁcally created for instructional purposes, designers may be interested in adding a function through which instructors can adjust informational scaffold type and content. We also observed that even though students in the frustration control group consistently used the error check tool, they did not use the tool that gives detailed hints about the next step. Squire (2006) and other game researchers stress that in addition to game content, gaming behavior observations should focus on game situations and social contexts. We believe this also applies to supportive game tool research. Players may perceive problem-solving scaffolds in the same manner that they view dictionaries or calculators for use in tests. Motivation is clearly an important factor in how they use scaffolding tools; in some games they may be perceived as reducing a sense of fairness. However, as Consalvo (2007) points out, most players primarily use scaffolds to reduce frustration caused by being stuck, and avoid using them unless they feel seriously frustrated by multiple failures. A game player looking to maximize fun will have a different motivation than a student who feels pressure to do well on an assigned taskdthat is, players want to keep playing, while test-takers want to end the experience as soon as possible. Sun, Lin and Ho (2006) have reviewed several different types of supportive tools commonly found in computer-based gamesdfor instance, “full walkthroughs” that give comprehensive instructions for solving puzzles or strategies for overcoming challenges, and “treasure maps” that reveal the locations of hidden valuables. Note that many supportive tools are developed by players (rather than designers) who are motivated by the desire to earn respect or thanks from other players in their communities. However, the results of their innovations make them worthy of attention from educational game developers.",

In measuring results of learning from the simulation environments, special attention was given to assessing intuitive knowledge as compared to deﬁnitional knowledge. Three experimental conditions were created that differed with respect to the supportive measures available: one group of learners used both model progression and assignments, one group was only supported with model progression, and the third group was provided with neither model progression nor assignments. The results showed a small gain in deﬁnitional knowledge for all three conditions. The gain in intuitive knowledge was considerable and differed across the experimental groups in favour of the con- ditions in which assignments and/or model progression were present.

Five years of experimentation at the United States Naval Academy indicates that Andes significantly improves student learning.  Andes’ key feature appears to be the grain-size of interaction.

        "abstract": " Abstract: Often a lesson requires learners to reflect on their learning task, to stop and think about what they are doing, how, and why. One way educators can foster this kind of metacognition is to utilize  the  Socratic  Method;  ask  learners  probing  questions  to  get  them  to  examine  their  own thinking  and  assist  them  in  an  inquiry  process.  When  there  are  not  enough  educators  skilled  in facilitating  Socratic  dialogue  available  to  help  all  the  learners  in  a  learning  environment  in  a timely  manner,  we  propose  using  Web-based  Socratic  tutoring  software  to  assist  with  the workload. We designed such a system and evaluated its effectiveness. The system, known as Sask, utilizes  the  Socratic  Method  via  human  computer  interaction  techniques  to  make  the  experience feel like a conversation with one’s educator. It also includes an authoring system designed to help educators  quickly  and  easily  build  the  tutors,  called  Mentors.  In  a  quasi-experimental  study  the Sask  system  had  a  statistically  significant  effect  size  of  0.69  on  students’  post-test  scores.  This implies  that  the  unique  interactive  design  of  Sask  Mentors  can  make  such  Socratic  software effective  tools  for  improving  a  learning  environment  where  human  educators  already  engage students in inquiry dialog.",

As the pedagogical design, the framework adopts an experiential learning model, which consists of five sequential but cyclic steps: the initial stage, concrete experience, observation and reflection, abstract conceptualization, and testing in new situations. Goal-based and scaffolding approaches to participatory simulations are integrated into the design to enhance students’ experiential learning. Using the SPSML framework, students can experience the following: (1) learning in augmented reality by  playing different participatory roles in mobile simulations in the micro-world on a  mobile device, and (2) interacting with people  in the real  world to  enhance  understanding  of  conceptual knowledge. An example of the SPSML-based system was implemented and evaluated. The experimental results show  that  the  system  was  conducive  to  the  students’  experiential  learning  and  motivation.

Forty-nine eighth graders received either multimedia-based instruction that emphasized molecular representations (n ¼ 16), or regular instruction (n ¼ 33). Students who received multimedia-based instruction that emphasized the molecular state of chemicals outperformed students from the regular instruction group in terms of the resulting test scores and the ease with which they could represent matter at the molecular level. However, results relating to the long-term effects suggest that the effectiveness of a multimedia-based environment can be improved if instruction includes additional prompting that requires students to attend to the correspondence between different representations of the same phenomena.

We developed Chemation, a learner-centered anima- tion tool, to allow seventh-grade students to construct (cid:223)ipbook-like simple animations to show molecular models and dynamic processes. Eight classes comprising 271 students were randomly assigned to three treatments in which students used Chemation to (1) design, in- terpret, and evaluate animations, (2) only design and interpret animations, or (3) only view and interpret teacher-made animations. We employed 2-factor analysis of covariance and calculated effect sizes to examine the impact of the three treatments on student posttest per- formances and on student-generated animations and interpretations during class. We used the pretest data as a covariate to reduce a potential bias related to students(cid:146) prior knowledge on their learning outcomes. The results indicate that designing animations coupled with peer evaluation is effective at improving student learning with instructional animation.

The teachers had at least 3 years of experience with Chemation and the inquiry-based chemistry curriculum with which the activities of using Chemation were aligned. Originally, each teacher had three seventh- grade classes participating in the study. Each class was randomly assigned to receive one of the treatments so that each teacher taught all three treatments. The purpose of this restricted random assignment was to reduce the potential confounding effect of instructional methods. However, after the school year started, Teacher C lost one of her seventh-grade classes (the third treatment) because of a change of assignment to teach eighth-grade science. In addition, the third treatment (T3, view and interpret) by Teacher B involved students with better mathematical ability (as selected by the school). However, the students in the three treatments provided by Teacher B had comparable prior knowledge of chemistry, as indicated by there being no signi(cid:222)cant difference in their pretest scores [F (2, 67) = 0.828, p = .441]. Most of the students at the three public middle schools were from ethnical minorities: 86% of Teacher A(cid:146)s students were African American students, 54% of the students in Teacher B(cid:146)s classes were Hispanic students, and 54% of the students in Teacher C(cid:146)s classes were African American students.

However, learning solely on the basis of self-explanations is connected with several restrictions, even when effective self-explaining is trained or elicited. Therefore, a coherent set of principles for integrating instructional explanations into learning via self-explanations was developed, implemented, and tested. An experiment with a control group (without instructional expla- nations; 20 student teachers) and an experimental group (with instructional explanations; n=28) was conducted. The results showed that the instructional explanations had a positive effect on learning, at least under certain conditions. In addition, deﬁcits in the use of the instructional explanations were identiﬁed and possible ways to improve the effectiveness of the instructional explanations were proposed.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The comprehension of these basic concepts was assessed by a criterion-referenced test which was then corrected immediately.

After this procedure, the participants were informed that they had time to study the worked-out examples for 45 min. In this phase, the experimental variation took place (with and without instruc- tional explanations). The participants were instructed to think aloud during this per- iod. According to the guidelines of Ericsson and Simon (1993), they were asked to talk aloud and verbalize anything that comes to mind. Before the study of examples, the thinking aloud procedure was trained by a simple warm-up problem. When the learners stopped talking for more than 15 s, the experimenter asked them to proceed thinking aloud by saying: “Please, continue talking”.

The scaﬀolds were embedded within a hypermedia program that placed students at the center of a problem in which they were trying to become the youngest person to ﬂy around the world in a balloon. One-hundred and eleven seventh grade students enrolled in a science and technology course worked in collaborative groups for a duration of 3 weeks to complete a project that included designing a balloon and a travel plan. Student groups used one of three problem-based, hypermedia programs: (1) a no scaﬀolding condition that did not provide access to scaﬀolds, (2) a scaﬀolding optional condition that provided access to scaﬀolds, but gave students the choice of whether or not to use them, and (3) a scaﬀolding required condition required students to complete all available scaﬀolds. Results revealed that students in the scaﬀolding optional and scaﬀolding required conditions performed signiﬁcantly better than students in the no scaﬀolding condition on one of the two components of the group project. Results also showed that student achievement levels were signiﬁcantly related to individual posttest scores; higher- achieving students scored better on the posttest than lower-achieving students. In addition, analyses of group notebooks conﬁrmed qualitative diﬀerences between stu- dents in the various conditions. Speciﬁcally, those in the scaﬀolding required condition produced more highly organized project notebooks containing a higher percentage of entries directly relevant to the problem. These ﬁndings suggest that scaﬀolds may enhance inquiry and performance, especially when students are required to access and use them.",

As a result of a series of informal exit interviews, it became apparent that the outcome of the pilot study could poten- tially be attributed to the voice used in the two conditions that relied on aurally presented instructional explanations, namely the voice-plus-agent and voice-only conditions. Unlike Moreno et al.’s (2000) animated agent, which relied on a human voice to deliver its instructional content, the agent in the pilot study used a voice generated by a text-to-speech engine that lacked many of the qualities associated with a human voice. A number of participants reported having to concentrate to understand what the computer- generated voice was saying. This outcome may have been the result of limitations associated with the text-to-speech engine’s voice quality, which can sound synthesized. To date, text-to- speech engines are unable to adequately capture the subtle nuances of a human voice, for instance the modulation and pace of a human voice. As a result, most text-to-speech voices sound synthesized, which makes them difficult to listen to for prolonged periods of time. Because the text-to-speech engine used in the pilot study could have compromised the performance of the voice-only and voice-plus-agent conditions that relied on aurally delivered expla- nations, the subsequent experiments were conducted using audio recordings of a human tutor in place of the text-to-speech engine.",

Two groups of students used a web-based learning environment to criss-cross and study case- based material in the software project management domain. The experimental group was additionally prompted to con- sistently answer a set of questions based on a model of context-generating processes, meant to engage students in deeper processing of information presented in cases. Students were also classiﬁed as having either ‘‘complex’’ or ‘‘simple’’ EB pro- ﬁle (based on their epistemological beliefs record), thereby establishing a 2 · 2 factorial design. Results indicated that scaf- folding treatment had a signiﬁcant main eﬀect on students’ performance, with the experimental group performing better in both domain knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer post-test items. There is also tentative indication that EB pro- ﬁle and scaﬀolding treatment interact, with complex-EB learners beneﬁting most from the scaﬀolded condition. Overall, the study provides evidence that it is possible to improve individual learning in a technology environment for case-based learning, by implementing appropriate questioning strategies that trigger students to activate their context-generating cog- nitive processes, while studying the contextually rich material of cases.

        "abstract": " Abstract Metacognition and self-regulation are important for developing effective learn- ing in the classroom and beyond, but novice learners often lack effective metacognitive and self-regulatory skills. However, researchers have demonstrated that metacognitive processes can be developed through practice and appropriate scaffolding. Betty’s Brain, an open- ended computer-based learning environment, helps students practice their cognitive skills and develop related metacognitive strategies as they learn science topics. In this paper, we analyze students’ activity sequences in a study that compared different categories of adap- tive scaffolding in Betty’s Brain. The analysis techniques for measuring students’ cognitive and metacognitive processes extend our previous work on using sequence mining meth- ods to discover students’ frequently-used behavior patterns by (i) developing a systematic approach for interpreting derived behavior patterns using a cognitive/metacognitive task model and (ii) analyzing the evolution of students’ frequent behavior patterns over time. Our results show that it is possible to identify students’ learning behaviors and analyze their evolution as they work in the Betty’s Brain environment. Further, the results illustrate that changes in student behavior were generally consistent with the scaffolding provided, suggesting that these metacognitive strategies can be taught to middle school students in computer-based learning environments.",

A regulative support tool called the Process Coordinator (PC) was designed to assist students in planning, monitoring, and evaluating their investigative efforts within this environment. In an empirical evaluation, 20 dyads received a “full” version of the PC with regulative assistance; dyads in the control group (n=15) worked with an “empty” PC which contained minimal structures for regulative support. Results showed that both the frequency and duration of regulative tool use differed in favor of the PC+ dyads, who also wrote better lab reports. PC− dyads viewed the content helpfiles more often and produced better domain models. Implications of these differential effects are discussed and suggestions for future research are advanced.",

Given the fact of within-class grouping, 6 medium achievers and 4 high achievers had to be grouped homogeneously. All 35 dyads were then randomly assigned to the PC+ condition (n=20) or the PC− condition (n=15).

In  this  study  we investigate  the  influence  of  visual  cues  and  outcome  feedback  on  students’  problem  solving, performance,  reasoning,  and  visual  attention  as  they  solve  conceptual  physics  problems containing a diagram. The participants (N=90) were enrolled in an algebra-based physics course and  were  individually  interviewed.  During  each  interview  students  solved  four  problem  sets while  their  eye  movements  were  recorded.  The  problem  diagrams  contained  regions  that  were relevant  to  solving  the  problem  correctly  and  separate  regions  related  to  common  incorrect responses. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a  transfer  problem.  Those  in  the  cued  condition  saw  visual  cues  overlaid  on  the  training problems. Those in the feedback conditions were told if their responses (answer and explanation) were correct or incorrect. Students’ verbal responses were used to determine their accuracy. The study  produced  two  major  findings.  First,  short  duration  visual  cues  coupled  with  correctness feedback  can  improve  problem  solving  performance  on  a  variety  of  insight  physics  problems, including transfer problems not sharing the surface features of the training problems, but instead sharing the underlying solution path. Thus, visual cues can facilitate re-representing a problem and  overcoming  impasse,  enabling  a  correct  solution.  Importantly,  these  cueing  effects  on problem solving did not involve the solvers’ attention necessarily embodying the solution to the problem. Instead, the cueing effects were caused by solvers attending to and integrating relevant information in the problems into a solution path. Second, these short duration visual cues when administered repeatedly over multiple training problems resulted in participants becoming more efficient at extracting the relevant information on the transfer problem, showing that such cues can  improve  the  automaticity  with  which  solvers  extract  relevant  information  from  a  problem.",

Based on the report of school teachers and student participants, there was no obvious overlap between the class topics and the math concepts addressed by the games over the 3 gaming weeks. To counterbalance the sequence of the games and control the effect of boredom, fatigue and practice, participants were randomly assigned to a random order of the three games over the 3 weeks. The gaming sessions took place at the computer labs of the two schools, with each student sitting before a desktop. An orientation was offered to all participants to get familiar with the computer gaming environment. The researchers of this study, along with two teachers and ﬁve education graduate students, worked as adult mentors for these participants during the gaming sessions. The adult mentors assisted participants’ interaction with the game tasks by mainly explaining the game-play skills (eg, the goal and rules of the games), prompting and giving feedback between moves, and occa- sionally answering questions on the game-related content. Two of the mentors were ﬂuent in Spanish. All participating graduate students (aged 28 to 45, with four females and one male) were recruited from an educational game design course. All adult mentors played through the three games multiple times. The researchers of the study demonstrated and practiced (role- played) game-based learner support with the other mentors during the 4-hour training period. The researchers then participated in all gaming sessions, observed and ensured the consistency of mentors in providing game-based learner support.",

The low-prior-knowledge group searched through the data exhaustively and used them to generate their plans. They were unsystematic in their planning and interpretation. They used the computer rep- resentations in their reasoning and worked at mapping the connections between the representations.

Students’ self-regulatory behaviors and teacher’s scaffolding of SRL were assessed through an analysis of their discourse during several collaborative problem-solving episodes.

However, these learning gains were quite small and were related to the self-regulatory behaviors observed in the dyads and their teacher’s scaffolding and instruction.

One hundred and eleven adolescents (n=111) were randomly assigned to one of three scaﬀolding conditions (adaptive scaﬀolding (AS), ﬁxed scaﬀolding (FS), or no scaﬀolding (NS)) and were trained to use a hypermedia environment to learn about the circulatory system. Pretest and posttest data were collected to measure the qualitative changes in students’ mental models of the topic and quantitative changes in their declarative knowledge. Verbal protocols were collected during the 40-minute learning task to examine how each condition aﬀected the way in which students regulated their learning. Findings revealed that learners in both the AS and NS conditions gained signiﬁcantly more declarative knowledge than did those in the FS condition. Also, the AS condition was associated with shift in learners’ mental models signiﬁcantly more than the other condi- tions. Associated with these signiﬁcant shifts in their mental models, learners in the AS condition regulated their learning by planning and activating prior knowledge, moni- toring their cognitive activities and their progress toward learning goals, using several eﬀective strategies, and engaging in adaptive help-seeking. By contrast, those in the NS condition used fewer eﬀective strategies, while those in the FS regulated their learning by using several regulatory processes which seemed to impede their learning. Implications for the design of scaﬀolds for fostering students’ self-regulated learning with hypermedia are presented.",

During the negotiation of meanings by e-mail, the two groups did not agree on what the main purpose of the activity should have been: i.e. whether it was the learning of the curricula content, or the implementation of a Web site.  As a result,  each  group  acted  according  to  their  local  interpretation,  rather  than engaging in the construction of a shared objective.  In this way, the two groups developed different registers in their informatics discourse: the Florence group interpreted the activity as ‘the implementation of a Web page’, and by stressing the  electronic  nature  of  the  final  product,  subordinated  the  text  and  its organisation to this goal; the Padua group defined the goal of the activity as ‘the construction of a hypertext about the curricula content, to be put on the Web’, and therefore focussed on the non-linear nature of the text, and the links among relevant concepts, rather than how it was to be implemented. The development of these two different registers made the construction of intersubjectivity, an implicit agreement to agree, impossible, and it is suggested that the electronic nature of the means of communication played a role in this, creating obstacles to discussion about unshared meanings and so constraining the motivation to collaborate. Local discussions led the students to work out different strategies towards the activity: the Florence group decided to design and implement the Web site from the very beginning, whereas the Padua group decided to focus on content understanding before working out and selecting abstracts to be put on the Web. The resulting lack of intersubjectivity led each local community to engage in so-called ‘informatic opportunism’ (Rocco & Warglien, 1995), namely attending to only those pieces of information and suggestions which were considered relevant for the intended goals of the local community, rather than trying to share meanings and goals. True  collaborative  work  is  based  on  the  construction  of  intersubjectivity which in turn requires more on-line feedback.  It seems that the renegotiation of goals and procedures is an on-line process that cannot be planned in advance. Asynchronous communication through e-mail undermines this and it is for this reason that it can obstruct the construction of a real electronic community.",

We developed Chemation, a learner-centered anima- tion tool, to allow seventh-grade students to construct (cid:223)ipbook-like simple animations to show molecular models and dynamic processes. Eight classes comprising 271 students were randomly assigned to three treatments in which students used Chemation to (1) design, in- terpret, and evaluate animations, (2) only design and interpret animations, or (3) only view and interpret teacher-made animations. We employed 2-factor analysis of covariance and calculated effect sizes to examine the impact of the three treatments on student posttest per- formances and on student-generated animations and interpretations during class. We used the pretest data as a covariate to reduce a potential bias related to students(cid:146) prior knowledge on their learning outcomes. The results indicate that designing animations coupled with peer evaluation is effective at improving student learning with instructional animation. On the other hand, the ef(cid:222)cacy of allowing students to only design animations without peer C(cid:2) 2009 evaluation is questionable compared with allowing students to view animations.

The teachers had at least 3 years of experience with Chemation and the inquiry-based chemistry curriculum with which the activities of using Chemation were aligned. Originally, each teacher had three seventh- grade classes participating in the study. Each class was randomly assigned to receive one of the treatments so that each teacher taught all three treatments. The purpose of this restricted random assignment was to reduce the potential confounding effect of instructional methods. However, after the school year started, Teacher C lost one of her seventh-grade classes (the third treatment) because of a change of assignment to teach eighth-grade science. In addition, the third treatment (T3, view and interpret) by Teacher B involved students with better mathematical ability (as selected by the school). However, the students in the three treatments provided by Teacher B had comparable prior knowledge of chemistry, as indicated by there being no signi(cid:222)cant difference in their pretest scores [F (2, 67) = 0.828, p = .441]. Most of the students at the three public middle schools were from ethnical minorities: 86% of Teacher A(cid:146)s students were African American students, 54% of the students in Teacher B(cid:146)s classes were Hispanic students, and 54% of the students in Teacher C(cid:146)s classes were African American students.

This paper will discuss current practice in CAD teaching and the way this relates to solid modeling. It will discuss the ﬁndings of current research with particular emphasis on the dif- ference between command knowledge and strategic knowledge and how this relates to the development of CAD expertise. Command knowledge is referred to as knowledge of the commands (algorithms or tools) and the procedures to use those tools within CAD software while strategic knowledge is concerned with knowledge of the alternate methods by which a speciﬁc task may be achieved and the process by which a choice may be made. The results of a recent experimental study into the teaching of CAD expertise will then be outlined and the implications for the teaching and learning process will be discussed.",

The  same  teacher,  using  the  same  curriculum  activities,  taught both classes. The focus classroom contained 33 students: 16 fifth-graders and 17 fourth-graders. All the focus fifth-grade boys (n = 9) and girls (n = 8) participated in a software design project on the brain during the pre- vious year. The 15 focus fourth-grade boys (n = 9) and girls (n = 7), on the  other  hand,  had  no  previous  experience  with  long-term  inquiry  in learning-through-design.  The  comparison  classroom  contained  30  stu- dents: 15 fifth-grade boys (n = 8) and girls (n = 7) and 15 fourth-grade boys (n = 10) and girls (n = 5). The main difference between the focus and comparison classrooms is that none of the comparison students had previous  experience  with  learning-through-design.  Comparison  fifth- graders  had,  however,  approximately  3  weeks  of  exposure  to  the  pro- gramming environment used in this study during the previous year. (This distinction between the fifth graders in both classes in terms of previous participation  in  the  culture  of  learning-through-design  versus  limited technical knowledge becomes crucial later on.) Ethnic breakdown of the children in both classes was as follows: 30 Caucasian, 14 Latino/Latina, 8 African American, 6 Asian, and 5 mixed ethnicity. We selected these two classes for our study because they had the same science teacher; she had worked with us on previous design projects. The  focus  class  had  nine  mixed-gender  teams,  and  each  included  at least 2 experienced fifth-graders and 2–3 inexperienced fourth-graders; the comparison class has also nine mixed-gender and mixed-grade teams with  similar  distributions.  The  teacher  and  researchers  decided  on  the composition of teams for each class according to principles of best prac- tice: ensuring a balance of gender and experience among team members as well as attempting to avoid known student personality clashes within teams.",

Results indicated that participants from both conditions reported higher levels of self-eﬃcacy immediately before the hypermedia learning task, and that they decreased their use of SRL processes related to monitoring as they progressed through the hypermedia learning task.

In this paper, the MUVE-based guid- ance system is investigated by addressing the fol- lowing questions: Experimental: • Do students with access to an individualized guidance system (IGS) containing extensive lev- els of ongoing guidance within the presentation of a MUVE-based science curriculum have greater learning on a test of science achieve- ment than students who had access to the same system with moderate levels of guidance or with no guidance?

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK impact of such design, functionality, and potential environments on student learning and motivation (Bers, 1999; Bers and Cassell, 1998; Corbit and DeV- arco, 2000; Slator et al., 2004). For example, the research team behind the Quest Atlantis (QA) MUVE has published a series of studies about the environment describing its beneﬁts on student motivation, learning outcomes, and on ‘making learning fun’ (Barab et al., 2005a, b). Quest Atlantis is an educational MUVE- based game in which students can take part in a large number of quests to save the people of a virtual Atlantis from destruction through environmental, moral, and social decay (Socially-Responsive Design Group, 2004). Elsewhere in this issue, Barab et al. describe a multi- level study investigating the learning beneﬁts associated with a QA curriculum designed to support scientiﬁc inquiry practices situated in realistic, socially relevant issues (a ‘socio-scientiﬁc’ approach). Students in the study completed a two week curriculum designed to support their development of environmental awareness and real-world science inquiry skills while investigating an interactive narrative in the QA environment. Results of the study show promising ﬁndings related to student engagement in the MUVE-based curriculum, sophisti- cated explanations of curricular processes and out- comes, and statistically signiﬁcant improvement on classroom and standardized assessments. In a previous Quest Atlantis study, Tuzan (2004) conducted a design ethnography to identify the motivational elements that supported student par- ticipation in Quest Atlantis. In his study, he identiﬁed a number of motivational elements in the MUVE- based educational game, including identity presenta- tion, playing, learning, rewards, immersive context, fantasy, uniqueness, creativity, curiosity, control and ownership, context of support, and social relations (Tuzan, 2004). Barab et al., (2005a) reported on the design-based research approach they took in design- ing and redesigning the Quest Atlantis environment in an ongoing eﬀort of generating, testing, reﬁning, and evolving theories of participation that work to ‘‘preserve the joy and meaning’’ in the processes of three rounds of learning. Qualitative analysis of studies into Quest Atlantis resulted in a better understanding of some weaknesses in the design of the world, including the need for a stronger and more engaging ‘backstory’ to the world.",

In addition, epistemological beliefs were presumed to play a role in solving ill-structured diagnosis–solution problems. Constraint-based discussion boards were implemented to scaf- fold pre-service teachers’ online discussions about behaviour management (diagnosis– solution) problems. The scaffolded discussion group generated more evidence notes and also generated more hypothesis messages and hypothesis testing messages as well as problem space construction messages. There was a relationship between epistemological beliefs and ill- structured problem solving. Simple knowledge, omniscient authority, and ﬁxed ability signiﬁ- cantly predicted problem-solving performance. A signiﬁcant negative relationship between simple knowledge and individual problem-solving performance was found. This implies that individuals who believe in simple knowledge may be less inclined to explore more solution alternatives. However, contrary to prediction, omniscient authority and ﬁxed ability beliefs were positively associated with problem-solving processes.",

This article will review this line of work through justifying and describing the rationale for its trajectory before presenting ongoing work that synthesizes and operationalizes its ﬁndings and insights. The ongoing work emphasizes an inclusive and per- sonalized approach to learning dialogue that stimulates reasoning, collaborative thinking and the development of argumentative dialogue practices. This is arguably relevant to most learning contexts, and especially to contemporary science education. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the role of dialogue in learning in the digital age.",

This study seeks  to  address  this  issue  through  the  SEEK  training  program,  which  encourages  learners  to evaluate  the  source  and  quality  of  the  information,  and  also  how  well  it  resonates  with  their existing  prior  knowledge.    Learners  were  either  trained  or  not  trained  using  the  SEEK  program when  they  completed  an  initial  Internet  research  task.    Learners  were  then  asked  to  complete  a second  Internet  research  task  in  another  domain  without  any  additional  guidance  several  days later.  Results indicate that learners who had received the SEEK training not only were better able to identify relevant from irrelevant sources, but also showed both higher overall levels of learning, and also greater learning gains.",

The  search task consisted of a list of six sites that had been returned from a Google search on the subject.  The participants’ goal was to identify which of the 6 possible sources should be used if someone was interested in determining whether the diet is harmful or not.  The six sites in this search task (in order of intended reliability) were: 1) The Journal of the American  Medical  Association  (specifically  a  published  article  reporting  a  controlled  randomized  trial),  2) BusinessWeek.com  (specifically  an  article  describing  the  JAMA  study),  3)  atkinsdietalert.org,  a  not-for-profit organization of (vegetarian) physicians providing information for laypeople with questions and concerns about high- protein  diets,  4)  WeightWatchers.com  (specifically  a  page  on  “the  truth  about  carbs”),  5)  Atkins.com  and  6)  a testimonial on the effectiveness of the Atkins diet from a personal homepage. After reading all 6 of the sites, participants were required to rank the sites in order of reliability from 1-6 and justify their rankings of each site (i.e., explain why they had ranked a certain site where they did).  Students in the SEEK training condition were given explicit guidance in their evaluations both before and after their reliability rankings (detailed below).

Therefore, scripts of demonstrated effectiveness are hardly used with learning platforms at other sites, and replication studies are rare. The approach of a platform-independent description language for scripts that allows for easy implementation of the same script on different platforms has not succeeded yet in making the transfer of scripts feasible. We present an alternative solution that treats the problem as a special case of providing support on top of diverse Web pages: In this case, the challenge is to trigger support based on the recognition of a Web page as belonging to a specific type of functionally equivalent pages such as the search query form or the results page of a search engine. The solution suggested has been implemented by means of a tool called S-COL (Scripting for Collaborative Online Learning) and allows for the sustainable development of scripts and scaffolds that can be used with a broad variety of content and platforms. The tool’s functions are described. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and ease of script reuse with S-COL, we describe the flexible re-implementation of a collaboration script for argumentation in S-COL and its adaptation to different learning platforms. To demonstrate that a collaboration script implemented in S-COL can actually foster learning, an empirical study about the effects of a specific script for collaborative online search on learning activities is presented. The further potentials and the limitations of the S-COL approach are discussed.",

The collaborative online learning environments were enriched by func- tions such as tracking, analyzing, and feeding back parameters of participation, collaboration, motivation, and emotional state to group members. Two studies were conducted to analyze ef- fects of these mechanisms. In the first study, we showed advantages of feedback on processes of group well-being, parameters of participation and interaction. In the second study, we combined feedback approach for monitoring and fostering collaborative behaviour with a de- sign-based approach using distributed learning resources. Results suggest that by distributing learning material collaboration can be positively influenced. However, this intervention had no substantial effect on cognitive outcomes or group climate.

The lower-achieving class means on a pretest of argument eval- uation ability (see the ‘‘Argument evaluation ability’’ section within data collection for a description of the test) were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the higher-achieving classes, F(1, 80) = 8.16, p \\ 0.01, ES = 0.61.

Ford, Smith, Weissbein, Gully, and Salas (1998) further illustrated the essential role of metacognitive skills in complex task training. Their study found that metacognitive activity was significantly related to knowledge acquisition, skilled performance at the end of training, and self-efficacy. Moreover, these three training outcomes (knowledge, skilled performance, and self-efficacy) positively influenced transfer of learning to a more complex task. The aforementioned findings are of particular relevance to computer-based complex task training because of the self-paced, learner-controlled nature of these environments. Complex learning tasks require both higher-level cognitive and metacognitive abilities (Hartman, 2001a). Verbal comprehen- sion ability, for example, has been shown to be indicative of skill acquisition of a complex task (Fleishman & Mumford, 1989). Furthermore, in previous work, we have similarly documented the significant positive relationship between metacomprehension ability and knowledge acquisition in complex task training (e.g., Fiore, Cuevas, Scielzo & Salas, 2002). Notably, studies have also demonstrated a significant positive relationship between meta- comprehension and verbal comprehension ability (e.g., Everson & Tobias, 1998; Maki et al., 1994; Moore, Zabrucky & Commander, 1997). In view of these findings and since studies indicate that metacognitive skills are amenable to training (e.g., Gourgey, 1998; Hartman, 2001a, 2001b; Maqsud, 1998; Mclnerney, Mclnerney & Marsh, 1997; Schmidt & Ford, 2001; Volet, 1991), it behooves instructional designers of learner-controlled computer- based training environments to determine which interventions prove most effective in order to develop plans for adapting instruction to the needs of the learner. Simply stated, a major goal of training should be to assist trainees, particularly low ability learners, in their attempts to better monitor their subjective learning experience (Bjork, 1994), that is, elevate their meta- cognitive awareness (comprehension monitoring). As such, the present study investigated the degree to which training manipulations could scaffold (i.e., serve as a supporting framework for) metacomprehension in trainees varying in verbal aptitudes. Specifically, we explored if diagrams could serve as a proxy for low verbal ability learners' limited metacognitive processes to enable them to successfully bridge critical aspects of the text (cf. Britton et al., 1998). Metacomprehension assessment Several measures have been used to investigate learners' metacognitive processes such as in feeling-of-knowing and judgement-of-learning assess- ments (for a review, see Maki, 1998).

        "abstract": " Abstract Online discussions provide opportunities for learners to engage in argumentative debate, but learners rarely formulate well-grounded arguments or benefit individually from participating in online discussions. Learners often do not explicitly warrant their arguments and fail to construct counterarguments (incomplete formal argumentation structure), which is hypothesized to impede individual knowledge acquisition. Computer-supported scripts have been found to support learners during online discussions. Such scripts can support specific discourse activities, such as the construction of single arguments, by supporting learners in explicitly warranting their claims or in constructing specific argumentation sequences, e.g., argument–counterargument sequences, during online discussions. Partici- pation in argumentative discourse is seen to promote both knowledge on argumentation and domain-specific knowledge. However, investigations regarding the extent to which computer-supported collaboration scripts can foster the formal quality of argumentation and thereby facilitate the individual acquisition of knowledge. One hundred and twenty (120) students of Educational Science participated in the study with a 2×2-factorial design (with vs. without script for the construction of single arguments and with vs. without script for the construction of argumentation sequences) and were randomly divided into groups of three. Results indicated that the collaboration scripts could improve the formal quality of single arguments and the formal quality of argumentation sequences in online discussions. Scripts also facilitated the acquisition of knowledge on argumentation, without affecting the acquisition of domain- specific knowledge.",

        "participants": " participants’ goals. The four dialogue types are (a) the critical discussion, (b) the explanatory inquiry, (c) the eristic discussion, and (d) the consensus dialogue. Walton and Krabbe (1995) and Keefer et al. (2000) emphasize that these types are ideal descriptions, but typically overlap with one another. For example, knowledge acquisition is the main goal of an explanatory inquiry. However, during an explanatory inquiry, two learners can defend different opinions as they would in a critical discussion. Hence, a way to include contextual aspects when defining the quality of argumentation is to consider the dialogue type. Based on the framework of Keefer et al. (2000), the construction of knowledge through collaborative argumentation can be classified as explanatory inquiry. In this dialogue type, a higher degree of formal structure of single arguments is supposed to be related to deep cognitive elaboration. Providing grounds (Baker 2003) and qualifying the relationship between claim and grounds by considering possible alternative viewpoints or explanations (Kuhn et al. 1997; Spiro and Jehng 1990) is assumed to contribute to the active construction of a knowledge representation and to be related to deeper cognitive elaboration. For example, Baker (2003) identifies analogies between supporting claims and self-explaining (Chi et al. 1989). In this line of thinking, the formal structure of a single argument can be regarded as an indicator of self-explaining. Furthermore, a high degree of formal structure in a single argument can be seen as an elaborated representation of the situation model (Kintsch 1991) of the individual learner that bases a larger number of claims on non- superficial inferences. First, claims that are supported by grounds can be regarded as self- explanations that indicate a high degree of formal structure. Second, qualifications of the relationship between claim and ground indicate the consideration of alternative (self-) explanations that indicate a high degree of formal structure. In turn, this deeper cognitive elaboration might foster knowledge construction. What is the formal quality of argumentation with respect to argumentation sequences? It has been hypothesized that the construction of complete argumentation sequences, and thereby the construction of this kind of sophisticated knowledge representations, is related to deep cognitive processes (Leitão 2000). Andriessen et al. (2003a) have argued that comparing and contrasting different positions during an argument may induce socio- cognitive conflicts sensu Doise and Mugny (1984). Socio-cognitive conflicts occur when learners discuss divergent or incompatible views. While counterarguments may raise socio- cognitive conflicts, integrations may initiate the process of resolving the socio-cognitive conflicts (Nastasi and Clements 1992). However, Leitão (2000) raises the point that counterarguments may not always be the opposite of an initial argument and, therefore, may not always increase socio-cognitive conflicts. They may “merely” present a different perspective on the same issue and thereby broaden the understanding of the concepts being learned. Considering counterarguments may lead the learner to elaborate different perspectives, compare different possible solutions, and decide which solution is most likely. Therefore, according to Leitão (2000), argumentation sequences that foster knowledge construction can be described according to this sequence: argument, counterargument, and integration. Having defined what we mean by the formal quality of argumentation in the context of construction of knowledge through collaborative argumentation, we now turn to the question of learning outcomes: What can be learned by participating in collaborative argumentation? Argumentative knowledge construction has been seen to foster both the acquisition of knowledge on argumentation (Kuhn 1991) as well as domain-specific knowledge. In reviewing the existing literature (Andriessen et al. 2003b; Astleitner 2002;",

However, empirical studies of digital game based learning (DGBL) have found mixed results regarding DGBL’s effect in improving comprehension. While learners generally enjoyed the DGBL learning experience, they often failed to comprehend the underlying message and construct knowledge. One possible explanation for the mixed results is that DGBL comprehension is moderated by individual differences in working memory and gaming expertise (knowledge, skills). Due to the procedural nature of communication in game design, learning from digital games requires processing multiple interacting elements within one’s working memory. The amount of available working memory that can be allocated to processing the educational messages is affected by the learner’s expertise about the game mechanics, along with the structure of the game design.",

Web-based support was developed with three supportive aids: A construction kit, a phenomenarium, and an information bank. Each supportive aid was expected to improve perceived process and product quality as well as learning. In a full factorial experiment, 266 educational science students constructed a competence map, whether or not supported by diﬀerent combinations of the three supportive aids. The availability of the construction kit and the phenomenarium had positive eﬀects on perceived process quality and learning. Furthermore, if there was no phenomenarium with example materials, the absence of the construction kit greatly diminished experienced support (i.e., one aspect of process quality); if a phenomenarium was present, the availability of the construction kit had relatively little eﬀect on perceived support. In general, this study indicates that well- designed Web-based support helps to construct competence maps.",

        "abstract": " Abstract. Meaningful discussion that facilitates reﬂective thinking can be initiated when learners raise thoughtful questions or provide critical feedback; however, generating eﬀective questions requires a certain level of domain knowledge and metacognitive skills of the question-askers. We propose a peer-questioning scaﬀolding framework intended to facilitate metacognition and learning through scaﬀolding eﬀective peer-questioning in online discussion. This framework assumes that novice students who lack domain and metacognitive knowledge can be scaﬀolded to generate meaningful interactions at an early stage of learning and the resulting peer-generated adaptive questions can facilitate learners’ metacognition. Thus, this study investigated the eﬀects of providing online scaﬀolding for generating adaptive questions to peers during online small group dis- cussion. A ﬁeld experimental time-series control-group design was employed as a mixed model for the research design. Thirty-nine college students from an online introductory class on turfgrass management participated in the study. The ﬁndings revealed that the scaﬀolds were useful to increase the frequency of student questioning behavior during online discussion. For some students, the online guidance reportedly served as ‘‘a starting point’’ to generate questions when they had diﬃculty asking questions. How- ever, the guidance did not improve the quality of questions and thus learning outcomes. The interview data indicated that peer-generated adaptive questions served a critical role in facilitating learner’s reﬂection and knowledge reconstruction. Further study should focus on the quality improvement of peer-generated questions while considering adaptive and dynamic forms of scaﬀolding and intermediate factors such as prior knowledge, metacognition, task complexity, and scaﬀolding type.",

The course is a required undergraduate course for obtaining either a de- gree or a certiﬁcate in turfgrass management, regularly oﬀered from a land-grant university in the northeastern United States, and delivered through the World Wide Web. The majority of participants were Caucasian male students who were pursuing a technical certiﬁcate in turfgrass management through the online distance education program. There were three reasons for choosing this class for this study. First, this online course had a series of discussion sessions as main part of the class activity, which was the focus of this study. Second, this course was oﬀered fully online and most of the communication among the students therefore was restricted to the given online learning environment. This could increase the internal validity of the experiment by preventing experimental treatment diﬀusion (Gall et al. 1996). This threat would be more possible in many other blended classes that combine face-to-face and online interactions among students. Last, this course was an intro- ductory-level course. Accordingly, the students in this course were ex- pected to be novices. The intervention in this study aimed to facilitate metacognition, which was assumed to be limited for novice learners.",

Introduction: English is acknowledged as the dominant language of communication in the age of globalisation and technology.  Therefore, teaching English as a foreign or second language has become vital in order to help the new generation cope with the vast changes and challenges of this age. Responding to this international trend, and based on the recommendations of many researchers who have proved that the earlier a learner is exposed to a foreign language the easier s/he learns it (Carroll, 1969; Jachbovitz, 1971; Sadek, 1986; Zughlool, 1988 & Elmuttawa, 1996), the Saudi Ministry of Education has introduced the teaching of English at the primary stage.  As such, it is hoped that pupils can learn English more effectively and use it for different communication purposes (Teacher‟s Manual, 1426 A.H.).  However, in a foreign language (FL) context, where English is not commonly spoken in the society, pupils are not sufficiently exposed to this foreign language.  It has therefore become urgent that English should be taught effectively in school classrooms.  In other words, the quality of the teaching of English must be emphasised and more attention should be paid to different language skills in order to achieve the objectives of teaching English, particularly developing the pupils' ability to communicate. However, communication is a two-sided process; a message cannot be communicated unless there is someone to receive it (Johnson & Morrow, 1981;Rivers, 1989 &Mee, 1999).  Listening comprehension is considered a pre- requisite for communication.  In Dakin's (1997, p. 31) words, “listening is one",

ACT supports both the free and the structured form of dialogue. The structured dialogue is implemented by two types of Scaffolding Sentence Templates (SST); i.e. sentence openers or communicative acts. The capability of adaptation is considered in the sense of making sugges- tions for the supported form of dialogue and SST type and providing the most meaningful and complete set of SST with respect to the learning outcomes addressed by the collaborative learn- ing activity and the model of collaboration followed by the group members. Also, ACT enables learners to have control on the adaptation by selecting the form of dialogue and the SST type they prefer to use and enriching the provided SST set with their own ones in order to cover their communication needs. The results from the formative evaluation of the tool showed that (i) the proposed dialogue form, SST type and the provided set of SST cover students’ communication needs, (ii) the capability of personalizing the communication by selecting the desired commu- nication means as well as by enriching the provided SST set satisﬁed students, and (iii) students used adequately both types of SST resulting into on-task and coherent dialogues.",

In order to revitalize education at the secondary level and in particular in the mathematics curriculum, educational reformers have advocated the incorporation of appropriate technologies to support learner-centered environments. The goal was to determine the relative effectiveness of a teacher-directed approach compared to a student-directed approach of utilizing Sketchpad to complete a project-based learning task. In general, and in the short term, the instructional model where the teacher provided structure and directed the problem solving activities of the students resulted in learner outcomes characterized by greater understanding of the concepts and less frustration with the process of using Sketchpad. However, many students in the self- directed group expressed a sense of self-confidence and pleasure with their accomplishments. (Contains 15 references and 2 figures.)

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS‘ LEARNING ABOUT GENETIC INHERITANCE THROUGH ON-LINE SCAFFOLDING SUPPORTS By Viola Manokore The main goal of school science is to enable learners to become scientifically literate through their participation in scientific discourses (McNeill & Krajcik, 2009). One of the key elements of scientific discourses is the ability to construct scientific explanations that consist of valid claims supported by appropriate evidence (e.g., McNeill & Krajcik, 2006, Sadler, 2004; Sandoval & Reiser, 2004). Curricula scaffolds may help students construct scientific explanations and achieve their learning goals. This dissertation study is part of a larger study designed to support fifth through seventh grade students‘ learning about genetic inheritance through curricula scaffolds. Seventh grade students in this study interacted with a Web Based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) unit called ―From Genotype to Phenotype‖ that had curricula scaffolds. Informed by the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration, two versions of the unit were developed around concepts on genetic inheritance. Version one of the units was explicit on explaining to students how to make a claim and support it with appropriate evidence. Although the science concepts covered were the same, Version two was not explicit on claims and evidence use. Embedded in the units were scaffolding supports in the form of prompts. This dissertation study explored students‘ responses to the scaffolding support prompts using a knowledge integration (KI) rubric as described by Linn and His (2000).",

In this study, a computer-supported environment for collaborative technical writing was developed. This system (Process-Writing Wizard) provides process-oriented scaffolds and a synchronous online chat room to facilitate real-time collaborative writing practice. It allows multiple students to work synchronously on collaborative writing tasks via the Internet. It also helps develop collaborative writing strategies, such as creating team agendas, brainstorming, creating team outlines, and generating team articles. An experiment was conducted to examine the effect of the system on EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students’ collaborative writing experiences. First, an attitude questionnaire was used to evaluate learners’ perceptions, acceptance, attitudes, and continuing motivation toward the functionalities and guidance provided by the system. Second, students’ writing products were examined to evaluate the effect of the system on EFL students’ collaborative writing quality, especially on content and organization. Finally, this study analyzed and coded students’ synchronous chats with three categories (article-related interactions, social interactions, and system operation-related interactions) to evaluate the effect of the system on students’ interactions. The results of the experiment showed: (1) the students had positive attitudes toward the system and continuing motivation to use the system in future writing tasks; (2) analysis of writing products suggested that students produced better content and organization with the support of the system; (3) the procedural facilitation provided by the system successfully scaffolded students to converse more in the category of article-related interactions. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed.",

In this generation process, learners’ cognitive and metacognitive regulation is one of the most critical factors inﬂuencing learning. However, learners are not always successful in regulating their own learning, especially in computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) where they are alone. Based on this rationale, the present study was designed to examine the effects of two scaffolding strategies—generative learning strategy prompts and metacognitive feedback—on learn- ers’ comprehension and self-regulation while learning the human heart system in a CBLE. Participants were 223 undergraduate student volunteers. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to conceptualize and empirically test a model that explains medi- ating processes among variables. Results revealed that the combination of generative learning strategy prompts with metacognitive feedback improved learners’ recall and comprehension by enhancing learners’ self-regulation and better use of highlighting and summarizing as generative learning strategies.",

We analyzed the effects of metacognitive scaffolding and of different forms of scaffolds on the learning outcomes at group and individual level. The results showed no effect of scaffolding on group performance, nor on the acquired indi- vidual domain knowledge, but a small effect on acquired individual metacognitive knowledge.

        "participants": " Sample and design 156 students in three schools divided over 6 classes participated in the study. The students were in Grade 4 (27), Grade 5 (82) or Grade 6 (47) of elementary education. This spread 123 792 I. Molenaar et al. across three grades was chosen to assess the effect of scaffolds on learning outcomes over different levels of metacognitive skillfulness. The teachers assigned the students to triads (52) within their class based on the principle of heterogeneity. Each triad consisted of male and female students. Students were rated on their school performance as low, medium and high achievers and every triad had one participant of each level. Finally each triad had to include at least one student with good reading abilities and one student with good computer abilities. The triads were randomly assigned to the three conditions: (1) No scaffolds (control group, 16 triads); (2) Structuring scaffolds (experimental group 1, 17 triads); and (3) Problematizing scaffolds (experimental group 2, 19 triads). The conditions were equally divided over the classes. The e-learning environment used in this study is called Ontdeknet. It focuses on sup- porting students in their collaboration with experts (Molenaar 2003). Ontdeknet is an open learning environment in which assignments are described as ‘projects’. A project consists of a broad overall assignment which is connected to an external expert who will provide the students with specialized information. The assignment is divided into smaller sub- assignments to support the students’ collaboration with the experts. Ontdeknet embeds the design elements of innovative learning arrangements in three aspects: constructive learning assignments, a situated environment and collaborative learning. Constructive learning assignments come to the fore in the self-initiating role the students play with respect to the learning strategies and topics to be learned. Students select their own learning goals and select the learning strategies to pursue these goals. The role of the experts is to support the students in acquiring their goals through providing information and expertise. Situated environment is related to this role of the expert, the information given by the experts concerns their professional or personal knowledge and experiences. It is edited for its value and relevance for students by the editor of Ontdeknet. The vocabulary used by the experts is related to the socio-cultural environment of their expertise, and their examples, rea- soning and explanations reﬂect their thinking as an expert about the topic (Ericsson and Charness 1994). Collaborative learning is implemented at two levels: students collabo- rating with an expert in a virtual environment and with each other in small groups behind the computer. The total duration of the experiment was eight lessons of 1 h. In the ﬁrst lesson, the students were given instructions about the assignment and the electronic learning envi- ronment. All students received the same instructions and all triads spent the same time working on the assignment (6 h). In six lessons the triads worked on an assignment called ‘‘Would you like to live abroad?’’ The goal of the assignment was to explore a country of choice (New Zealand or Iceland), write a paper on the ﬁndings and decide if they would like to live in this country. The triads worked on one computer and had access to an inhabitant of the country. They could consult the expert by asking questions and requesting information about different topics about the country that they were interested in. In the expert section, the requested information about the country was written by the expert and questions were answered in a forum. The assignment to write a paper about the country was preceded by four sub-assign- ments: introducing the group, writing a goal statement, selecting a country and specifying topics of interest in a mind map to further support the collaboration with the expert. All tasks were integrated into the working space of the triads, where they also wrote the paper. The performance of the triads was stored in the learning environment. All lessons were supervised by the same researcher. The 8th h was used for the measurement of individual domain and metacognitive knowledge.",

Fifteen pairs of medical students participated in two sessions in which the students used a virtual microscope as a diagnostic tool in the context of learning pathology. The slides provided the students with varying levels of visual and conceptual cueing. The sessions were videotaped, and the students’ reasoning while using the microscope was analysed. The students’ written answers were analysed in terms of the ﬁndings they made and the diagnoses suggested. At a general level, the results show that students engage actively in this kind of virtually-mediated environment. The visual and/or conceptual cues improve students’ performance, and guide the students’ perception and reasoning in a manner that is productive from the point of view of learning to make clinically relevant observations. Scaffolding students’ reasoning process through cues furthermore assists the students in avoiding the most obvious pitfalls such as overlooking critical areas of a specimen.

In particular, when working on complex  tasks,  they  often  need  to  acquire  extra  cognitive  resources  from  others  to  process  a  high  task  load.  However, without  support  high  task  load  and  organizing  knowledge  sharing  themselves  might  easily  overload  learners’  limited cognitive  capacities  because  learners  first  have  to  find  relevant  peer  tutors  (i.e.,  those  who  provide  help)  and  then maintain  the  social  interaction.  We  propose  to  design  a  peer-support  system  that  selects  tutors  and  provides  support during knowledge sharing. The pilot study reported here investigated the effects of two peer tutor competences, tutoring skills vs. content knowledge, on tutees’ (i.e., those who need help) cognitive load and learning performance. The results show  that  tutees  supported  by  tutors  with  tutoring  skills  experienced  lower  cognitive  load  and  had  better  learning performance  than  did  tutees  supported  by  tutors  with  content  knowledge.  This  is  in  line  with  our  assumption,  but  for confirmation  we  need  to  gather  more  data  in  a  full  study.  We  need  to  first  use  a  task  that  requires  learners  to  rely  on others to trigger higher cognitive skills to deal with high task load. Secondly we need to find a modus to ensure that the tutors follow the instructions to apply the particular competence.",

The 70 journal entries of 25 preservice elementary teachers are analyzed to characterize the teachers’ written reﬂection. One focus of the analysis is on how the preservice teachers integrate ideas about these aspects of teaching. The preservice teachers sometimes integrate ideas about learners with ideas about instruction. Further analyses illustrate the difference between integrating ideas and simply juxtaposing them. The paper illuminates how reﬂecting on multiple aspects of teaching may help new teachers integrate their knowledge and begin to develop a more complex view of teaching. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As we began to work with these operations during the design process ourselves, we recognized that access to these powerful operations can be a double-edged sword. For exam- ple, the ability to modify the color palette means that with a simple change to one display parameter, a visualization can be transformed from a multicolored, highly patterned color map to a blank, monochromatic field. We learned that an important component of a scientist's expertise is knowing how to set display parameters so that a data set will display in a meaningful form. Without adequate support, a nov- ice who does not yet understand the units or range of values in a data set can spend a great deal of time working with a visualization just to display it in a way that will allow him or her to begin to interpret it. To protect learners from undue frustration in the early stages of interpretation, we created a scaffold in the form of default dis- play settings for data. For each variable in the data library, we established default display settings for the color scheme, its range, and the units displayed. For tem- perature, for example, the default color scheme was made up of five colors ar- ranged in the order of the rainbow, and the default units were degrees Fahrenheit. Any time a user selected a data set to view, it was displayed using these defaults. The defaults served as a scaffold that enabled learners to begin to interpret visual- izations without needing to set display parameters that they may not yet under- stand. However, the ability to customize the display of visualizations still allowed learners to progress to more sophisticated interpretations. When we observed the Climate Visualizer's use in schools, we found that stu- dents at a wide range of ability levels were able to use its supportive interface to se- lect data and to display and interpret visualizations. The first activity that many students did with the Climate Visualizer was to research the weather conditions on the day they were born. With little or no instruction, students were able to retrieve the data for the date they were born, locate the cell on the visualization covering their birthplace, and use the display to identify temperature. In each of these steps, students took advantage of the contextual information embedded in the user-interface. For example, the map overlay and latitude/longitude markings en- abled students to locate the area they were interested in, and the readout that tracks the movement of the cursor enabled them to access the underlying data values. These steps would have been extremely difficult if not impossible using an infor- mation-poor interface like the one in Figure 3. Unfortunately, we had few opportu- nities to see whether the supportive interface made more sophisticated analyses of data more accessible because of other challenges discussed in the next section. In addition to the issue of accessibility, our design for the Climate Visualizer also addressed the challenge that students face in managing extended activities in inquiry-based learning.

An aspect of scaffolding that is often ignored is the fading of support as the learner masters the skill. It has been suggested that there is a risk of over-relying on the support of integrated media in computer-assisted instruction. A three-dimension (3-D) model of scaffolding that incorporates level of subtask, level of support, and number of repetitions of practice has been proposed to vary the technology support systematically in response to the learner's performance. The 3-D contingent scaffolding model was implemented in a computer-based instructional program for statistics called \"Hypothesis Testing--the Z-Test\" in order to establish baseline data for integrated media-based instruction or a hypermedia learning environment. The scaffolded instruction as evaluated in terms of knowledge maintenance and transfer by comparing it to full-support instruction and least-support instruction.",

Collaborative review and assessment involves the student, their peers  and  tutor  in  thoughtful  and  critical  examination  of  each  student’s  course  work.  The  process  involves  two  stages: review  and  discussion  of  the  student’s  work  with  a  view  to  bringing  different  critical  yet  supportive  perspectives  to  the work. This is followed by the use of two sets of criteria to make judgements on the student’s work: one set provided by the student, the other by the tutor. The purpose of collaborative assessment is to foster a learning approach to assessment and to develop  a  shared  power  relationship  with  students.  From  analysis  of  face  to  face  interviews,  examination  of  e-learning discussions  and  student  completed  questionnaires,  a  set  of  analytic  categories  was  developed  describing  the  learners’ experiences of collaborative assessment. The paper focuses on analysing and discussing these categories of experience. The research  shows  that  collaborative  e-learning  assessment  helps  students  move  away  from  dependence  on  lecturers  as  the only or major source of judgement about the quality of learning. Students develop skill and know how about self and peer assessment and see themselves as competent in making judgements about their own and each other’s work, which are good lifelong learning skills.",

This investigation studied the effect of different levels of scoring criteria speciﬁcity and written feedback requests on the distribution of scores, the correlation between peer and self-assessments and the quantity and nature of written feedback. Increasing the number of criteria decreased the mean scores and increased the standard deviations of the peer and self-assessments, providing a wider range of scores and increasing the sensitivity of the instrument. Correlation between peer and self-as- sessment was improved with more speciﬁc criteria, depending on the statistic used. However, analysis revealed that the more speciﬁc written feedback requests elicited more peer feedback. Educators should consider the effects of criteria speciﬁcity and written feedback solicitation on rater behaviour when designing these instruments.",

There was no signiﬁcant difference in the grade point averages of the two groups when they entered the study. The setting for the study was a course entitled Clinical Simulations, which is a clinical science capstone course in the curriculum. The course was designed in a problem-based learning format, where students were randomly divided into groups of ﬁve or six and then randomly assigned to faculty advisors. Each group was then given a complex patient case problem that involved both the learning of new material and the integration of previously learned material. The product of their group work was an oral presentation to the rest of their class, with all the group members participating equally, along with a handout. At the end of each group presentation, each member of the class audience (the peer assessment group) and each presenter (the self-assessment group) ﬁlled out a group presentation assessment. All assessments were of the entire group; there were no assessments of individual performance. Faculty advisors also ﬁlled out an assessment form, but their data was not used in this study, because several of the groups were advised by the author, eliminating those assessments as data sources, which meant that those groups could not be triangulated with faculty assessments. The assessment instrument used for the class of 2000 (Appendix A) consisted of ﬁve items, each phrased as a speciﬁc question. Each item was scored on a 0 (unsatisfactory) to 4 (excellent) scale (for a total of 20 points), and space was left under each item for written feedback by the rater, which was requested but not required. This instrument was based on instruments used in previous studies dealing with the evaluation of oral presentations (Falchikov, 1995; Orsmond et al., 1996; Culbertson et al., 1997; Heylings & Stefani, 1997; MacAlpine, 1999). Initial analysis of the data from these assessments revealed that the scoring tendencies tended to be in a very narrow range, at the high end of the scale, as will be discussed later. The investigator, who was the coordinator for the course, felt that the assessments were not differentiating accurately the varying levels of performance among the presenting groups. For the next iteration of the course (for the class of 2001), a revised instrument was developed (Appendix B) that expanded the scoring criteria from 5 to 25. These items, which were phrased in the form of statements, were directed at more speciﬁc aspects of group presentation performance and were based on student outcome expectations the MPT program uses for outcome assessments and accreditation standards. Each item was still scored on a 0–4 scale (for a possible total of 100 points), but it was deemed impractical to ask for written feedback speciﬁcally for each item, and so it was requested only at the end of the instrument. The scores from the two classes were analysed with descriptive statistics and distribution frequencies to examine the scoring tendencies for each year. The relation- ships between peer and self-assessment were explored using two correlational statistics. Pearson product-moment coefﬁcients (r) are commonly used for determining systematic relationships between groups of assessors (Rezler, 1989; Falchikov, 1995; Orsmond et",

        "abstract": " Abstract Design is a critical to the successful development of any interactive learning environment (ILE). Moreover, in technology enhanced learning (TEL), the design process requires input   from   many   diverse   areas   of   expertise.   As   such,   anyone   undertaking   tool development   is   required   to   directly   address   the   design   challenge   from   multiple perspectives. We provide a motivation and rationale for design approaches for learning technologies that draws upon Simon's seminal proposition of Design Science (Simon, 1969). We then review the application of Design Experiments (Brown, 1992) and Design Patterns (Alexander et al., 1977) and argue that a patterns approach has the potential to address many of the critical challenges faced by learning technologists.",

To assess their effectiveness  for  users learning HyperCardTu, we  compared carefully matched animated demonstra- tions,  procedural  textual  instructions,  and  demonstrations  combined  with spoken procedural text. During training, demonstration users were faster and more  accurate  than  text-only  users.  Without  the  instructions,  7  days later, text-only users were faster and as accurate as demonstration users in recalling and performing identical and similar tasks without the instructions. Surpris- ingly, users of  the combined demonstrations with spoken text closely mirrored the results of  the demonstration-only users.  The poor retention and transfer for  the  demonstration  users  appeared  to  be  due  to  mimicry  of  the  demon- strated  procedures.  Even  with  accompanying spoken text,  the  simplicity of using  animated  demonstrations  may  encourage  superficial  processing  and disregard for  the procedural text.",

The model emerged through a qualitative study of two experienced, elementary teachers during their first year of using a commercially published, reform-oriented textbook that had been adopted by their district (Remillard 1996). The aim of the study was to examine teachers’ interactions with a new textbook in order to gain insight into the potential for curriculum materials to contribute to reform in mathematics teach- ing. The resulting model integrates research on teachers’ use of curriculum mate- rials (cf. Stodolsky 1989) and studies of teachers’ construction of curriculum in their classrooms (cf. Doyle 1993). The model includes three arenas in which teach- ers engage in curriculum development: design, construction, and curriculum map- ping. Each arena defines a particular realm of the curriculum development process about which teachers explicitly or implicitly make different types of decisions. The design arena involves selecting and designing mathematical tasks. The construction arena involves enacting these tasks in the classroom and responding to students’ encounters with them. The curriculum mapping arena involves determining the organization and content of the entire curriculum into which daily events fit. Through articulating each piece of the model, the author highlights the complex and multidimensional nature of teachers’ curriculum processes, identifies signifi- cant characteristics of each arena that have implications for textbook use and instructional change, and indicates areas that call for further understanding and research.",

The unique  feature  in  CeLS's  design  is  its  ability  to  use  learners'  products  from  previous  stages  and  to conduct  complex,  multi-stage,  structured  activities.  CeLS  provides  a  sample  of  content-free  Activity Structures and a searchable domain of all the activities that were implemented with students. Teachers can explore these examples, adopt them for personal use and adapt their structure and content to suit their  specific needs. If none  of  the  existing pre-designed  resources  seems  to  suit  the needs,  they  can create new structures using basic building blocks.",

Thus, for example, if  teachers are discussing students'  problems in  understanding a concept, students might be  engaged along with them in the discussion. Although openness is an important princi- 276 SCARDAMALIA AND BEREITER ple, it must also be recognized  that knowledge building requires private and directed discussions at times,  so one of the many  challenges in coping with educational uses of a communal data base is to interleave open and private discourses, and to provide conditions for freedom from irrelevant, boring, or otherwise unhelpful information. With  the  advent  of  wide-area  networks  for  schools,  students  will  have access to all manner of data bases, CD-ROMs,  video, microworlds,  and so forth,  as  well  as  links  to  live  experts  and  more  advanced  students.  The challenge we see for educational technology  is to preserve a central role for the students themselves, lest they be reduced to passivity  by the overwhelm- ing amounts of authoritative external information available. The surest way to  keep  the  students  in  the  central  role,  it  would  seem,  is  to  ensure  that contacts  with  outside  sources  grow  out  of  the  local  knowledge-building discourse  and  that  the  obtained  information  is brought  back  into  that  dis- course in ways consistent with the goals and plans of the local group. At  this  point,  it  is  fanciful  (but  nonetheless  exciting)  to  contemplate advantages of having communal structures that span the whole of the school years and that  also profitably  engage those in research  institutes  and other knowledge-creation  enterprises.  The  fancifulness  is  not  with  the  technol- ogy-recent  developments make that by  far the easy  part. The problems to be  solved  are  educational.  As  the  preceding  discussion  indicates,  it  is  the nature  of  the  classroom  discourse  that  determines  whether  the  classroom functions as a knowledge-building  community rather than, say, a classroom focused on pursuit of  individual interests or on teacher-organized  activities. In the next section, we turn to the issue of CSILE as an enabling technology for knowledge-building discourse. HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP REFRAME CLASSROOM DISCOURSE TO SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE BUILDING In following sections, we suggest means for reframing classroom discourse to  support  knowledge  building  in  ways extensible  to out-of-school  knowl- edge-advancing  enterprises  and  indicate  how  we  are attempting  to realize these through CSILE. A  Community  Database  at  the  Center  of  Classroom Discourse The community  database  of  CSILE  is  created  by  students.  Users  produce public-access  material, not simply material to be turned in for grading, and do so in a context that engages others on their behalf. Although students can choose  to  keep  material  private,  the  default  option  is  public.  Using  net- worked  microcomputers, a number of  users (located  within  or  outside  the school walls) can simultaneously create text or graphical notes to add to the database, searching existing notes, commenting on other students' notes, or organizing notes into more complex informational structures. The commu- nity database serves as an objectification of a group's  advancing knowledge, much as do the accumulating issues of a scholarly journal but with additional facilities for reframing ideas and placing them in new contexts. In local-area configurations, students' writings are available to classmates, not just  to the teacher, and that  gives them a feel for speaking and being responsible to a broader  audience. In  wide-area  configurations,  the  audience  is  expanded, and  with  that  comes an  increased need  to  address problems and  represent knowledge in ways that are comprehensible to people outside the immediate context. CSILE is designed to frame students' ideas in ways extensible to the broader  knowledge-building community and, concomitantly, to  resist  dis- course frameworks workable only in schools. Commitment to the notion that students can serve as legitimate partners in knowledge building is reflected in the fact that they are placed center front in the knowledge-creation process as authors of databases, not simply reviewers of databases created by others. The database, which is  wholly  created by  students, consists of  text  and graphical  notes.  Graphical  notes can  be  used  to  create  organizing frame- works.  Anyone  can  add  a  comment  to  a  note  or  attach  a  graphic  note subordinate to another graphic note, but only authors can edit or delete notes. Authors are notified when a comment has been made on one of  their notes, and  the  notes  of  all  participants  are  accessible  through  database  search",

The topic ‘Ecology of Mediterranean Habitats’, for example, was taught through a two- week field study at the Ecological Garden. Teams of 2–3 students investigated various topics, and collected and presented their data. While teaching the topic of air quality, the students climbed up onto a roof of one of the high buildings in the campus in order to draw a ‘pollution map’ of the nearby industrial region and then constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of the main concepts and the relation- ships among them. The vast majority of the students indicated that they joined the course mainly in order  to  gain  two  more  credits.  The  group  was  heterogeneous  with  respect  to  its ethnicity as well. Arab students (16) and immigrants from the former Soviet Union (7) made up the majority of the group. This is important because of language chal- lenges that some of these students face. The students’ major subjects are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Participants’ background",

Half of the participants were provided with iSTART training. Comprehension of a science passage was assessed with text-based and bridging-inference questions.  The results indicated that children with less prior knowledge  about  reading  strategies  performed  significantly  better  on  text-based  questions  if  they  received  iSTART training.  Conversely for high-strategy knowledge students, iSTART improved comprehension over control students for bridging–inference questions.

After the pretest, the students began using the evolution hypermedia program and completed a short in- troduction to the features of the program. Next, they worked on the hypermedia lesson with the various cognitive preparation features previously described. These included • Reading a short introduction to evolution. • Viewing two mental model visualizations of evolution (one representing a naive model and the other the expert neo-Darwinian model). • Using the Story Maker for scaffolded problem solving to answer the chee- tah evolution problem (same problem presented during pretest think aloud). • Reading expository text dealing with the history of science and the change of scientific views of evolution from Lamarckism to Darwinism. • Considering thought experiments intended to promote conceptual change (e.g., “If your father had lost his arm, would that acquired trait be passed on to you?”). • Working through an overview to five themes of neo-Darwinian theory: population variety, environmental conditions, natural selection, origin of new traits, and generations and time (e.g., Figure 2). During Session 2, the students completed another Story Maker problem solving activity, read a short review of the main themes related to the basic neo-Darwinian model of evolution by natural selection, studied The Case of the Peppered Moth and Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria hypermedia cases on evolutionary biology, and worked on Special Topics questions one and two as part of the guided conceptual criss-crossing learning activity. After a short break, the students then completed the Session 2 evaluation items and problem-solving tasks.

The next ﬁve were adaptations of knowledge-building scaffolds. Results demonstrated that digital augmentations, posted questions, and participation in collaborative groups may be the optimal design for improving conceptual learning (content knowledge) while preserving informal participation behaviors. However, our results also showed that obtaining deeper cognitive gains such as ability to theorize only occurred in the most highly scaffolded condition in which students demonstrated much decreased informal participation behaviors.

In a teaching laboratory with a high instructor-to-student ratio, mobile devices can provide a platform for expert modeling and scaffolding during the laboratory sessions. This research study provides data collected on the effectiveness of podcasts delivered as needed in a ﬁrst-semester general chemistry laboratory setting. Podcasts with audio and visual tracks covering essential laboratory techniques and central concepts that aid in experimental design or data processing were pre- pared and made available for students to access on an as-needed basis on iPhones(cid:3) or iPod touches(cid:3). Research focused in three areas: the extent of podcast usage, the numbers and types of interactions between instructors and student laboratory teams, and student performance on graded assignments. Data analysis indicates that on average the podcast treatment laboratory teams accessed a podcast 2.86 times during the laboratory period during each week that podcasts were available.

The remaining 28.3 % had not taken the ACT, but had taken the SAT I test. Concordance tables published on the ACT and College Board Websites provide scaled scores for con- version of composite SAT I scores to estimated composite ACT scores (ACT-SAT Concordance 2010). For the pur- pose of the comparison of treatment groups in this study, students in our sample who did not have ACT scores were assigned an estimated ACT score using the published concordance. It is widely recognized that academic preparation is correlated with student success at the university level (for example: Andrews and Andrews 1979; Tai et al. 2006). We anticipated that student behavioral engagement (effort, participation, actions taken) might also affect student out- comes (Appleton et al. 2008; Crede´ and Kuncel 2008). A recent meta-analysis of the relationship between class attendance and academic performance reached the con- clusion that ‘‘class attendance appears to be a better pre- dictor of college grades than any other known predictor of college grades—including SAT scores, HSGPA, studying skills, and the amount of time spent studying’’ (Crede´ et al. 2010, p. 288). Attendance in a single course was predictive of level of success in all courses as measured by overall GPA. Thus, as another measure of similarity between the two treatment groups, we chose to focus on behavioral engagement through the level of student participation as measured primarily by class attendance. Attendance in the laboratory course and participation in experiments is compulsory. However, each laboratory student was required to be concurrently enrolled in a general chemistry lecture course. Attendance in the lecture course is strongly encouraged, but not mandatory for suc- cessful completion. In the lecture course, students are also assigned self-paced homework and have the opportunity to participate in class discussions or tutoring hours. We felt we might gain a more accurate independent measure of individual student behavioral engagement in learning chemistry by looking at the level of chemistry lecture course participation for each student. Equally important is that curriculum for the two courses (lecture and lab) were carefully coordinated and thus extent of participation in the",

We  investigated  how  chemistry  teachers  and  high  school  students  who  enrolled  in  a  special  program perceive the nature and functions of models by using a model perception questionnaire. In the research 34 pre-  and  in-service  teachers  attended  a  14  hours  workshop  on  models  and  their  model  perception  was investigated  with  the  model  questionnaire.  This  questionnaire  was  also  administered  to  two  groups  of high-school  chemistry  students  –  experimental  and  control  –  which  studied  chemical  bonding  and structure. The teachers of the experimental group participated in the training and emphasized the model concept via using various models including computerized molecular modeling, whereas the control group teachers taught the topic in the traditional way, without the aid of computer and without emphasizing the model  concept.  Overall,  the in-service training on models has improved several aspects of the teachers' model  perception  in  both  stages.  This finding is confirmed by the significant difference found between the  experimental  and  control  groups  of  the  high  school  students.  Students’  results  indicate  the effectiveness  of  the  treatment  on  students’  conceptualizing  the  meanings  of  models,  especially  in  the domain of chemistry. [Chem. Educ. Res. Pract.

Educators have been aware of this problem and have urged their students to prepare in different ways, such as by self-repar- ation, handing in a pre-laboratory assignment, or attending a pre-laboratory preparation session. Many studies report different approaches to laboratory preparation; however comparative investigations are scarce. This article reports on an empirical study that spanned over 3 years. Three preparation modes (PMs) are compared: (a) PM1—pre-laboratory home assignment with the laboratory manual and virtual laboratory software; (b) PM2—pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the laboratory manual only; and (c) PM3—pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the virtual laboratory and the laboratory manual. Measurements of the laboratory learning outcomes by means of pre- and post-laboratory tests and a comprehensive laboratory report indicate that PM3 is the most efﬁcient approach. Discussions of the result in light of pedagogical and cognitive science theories are provided. (cid:1) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The process of recognizing student is performed as a result of observations which ITS applies on students. A number of uncertainties arise during these observations. In order to minimize learning uncertainties and create a productive and effective ITS, type-2 fuzzy logic, one of the artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, is used in the system developed in this study. In order to show the effectiveness of the developed web-based ITS, it is applied to the teaching of a basic Control Course. The educational evaluation of the system is presented in the paper.

Furthermore, students can prepare their experiment lessons before going to the laboratory and revise them whenever, and as many times as they want to. Consequently, by using the computer as a complementary educational tool, the quality of university teaching is greatly improved. (cid:1) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It describes PSpice implementation of the core power electronic circuits that depend on thyristor circuits to identify behaviors with load variations. It uses the developed simulation models to support and enhance power electronics education at the undergraduate level. These simulations successfully integrate the contents of the power electronic laboratory course. A study of the impact of these simulations on the results of the students showed that it helped them to master the course contents and to gain better grades. (cid:1) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The system utilizes data mining, clustering analysis, and statistical tools for clustering students according to their online learning behaviors, learning achievements, and thinking styles.

By using this system, teachers can apply different remedial strategies according to the different online learning behaviors of students. The students in this study received adaptive warning messages and remedial treatments according to their individual learning situations. The results revealed that the proposed strategy can encourage students whose online learning performances are initially evaluated as good or medium and improve their online learning performances. In the case of students with poor online learning performances, this system improves not only their performances but also their learning achievements. This is achieved by continuously dispatching adaptive warning messages to the students in question. The relationship between thinking styles and online learning achievements is also considered in this study. It is indicated that a strategy of sending adaptive warning messages also works well on students with different thinking styles. (cid:1)2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, virtual laboratory, which is found to have wide application ﬁeld in recent years, is introduced. For this purpose, a virtual electrical machine lab for electrical engineering lab courses is developed. An example of application was presented for the control of synchronous motor and no-load and blocked rotor test of synchronous generator.

However, the procedures are usually complicated and require large amounts of preparation to ensure the success of the experiment. In this research, current paper-based preparations are improved by providing virtual equipment that can provide instant and realistic feedback, with the ability to deliver these over the Internet. This research selected the Venturi tube experiment as a case study. Five steps were defined in the development process: (1) defining the experiment procedure, (2) building a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality model, (3) adding procedure controllers, (4) adding physics rules to the virtual world, and (5) adding 3D manipulation func- tions. The virtual experiment of Venturi tube was implemented and evaluated in a real class, with the involvement of 48 undergraduate students in National Taiwan University. The students were separated randomly into two groups, one using paper-based preparation and the other using the virtual equipment for experiment preparation. The results showed that the students who prepared using the virtual equip- ment performed significantly better in both speed and skill application in the real experiment.

Results showed that ADAM effectively enhanced students’ self-reported understanding of transportation planning and their skills of forming opinions, evaluating projects, and making judgments. Students who prefer visual and active learning were found to beneﬁt more than others through simulation-based teaching strategy. Findings in this research could have signiﬁcant implications for future practice of simulation-based teaching strategy.",

The  main results  were:  significant  effects  were  observed  for  IS  on  the  post-test  of intuitive  understanding,  flexible  application  and  knowledge  integration; no  main  effect  was  demonstrated  for  ES,  and  there  was  a  marginally significant interactive effect for ES and IS on the intuitive understanding test. A process analysis showed that the successful learners had designed more well-controlled experiments than the failing ones. Learning support in  a  simulation  environment  should  be  directed  toward  the  three perspectives  to  invite  meaningful,  systematic  and  reflective  discovery learning.",

In model progression, the model underlying the simulation is not offered in its full complexity from the start, but variables are gradually introduced. Assignments are small exercises that help the learner to define goals during discovery learning. Subjects were 63 first year students in physics at a university level. Three experimuiltal conditions were created: in one, learners received a computer simclation together with model progression and assignments; in the second, only model progression was added; and in the third (control) condition, neither model progression nor assignments were available. For measuring learning results, three types of tests were used: a definitional test, measuring students' factual knowledge of the domain; an intuitive test, measuring students' insight; and a test measuring students' propositional knowledge. The definitional and intuitive test were used as pre- and post-test, and the propositional test was only used as a post-test. All student actions were logged and several aspects of cognitive load were measured with an electronic questionnaire.",

Annotations  may  catch  participants’  attention  thus  help  them  focus  on annotated  concepts  or  subjects.  In  addition,  annotations  could  help  participants construct  their  own  knowledge  and  concepts.  Furthermore,  annotations  could  help participants bookmark annotated areas and use them as indexes or reminders for later references.  Moreover,  embedded  annotations  may  help  participants  discuss  and review  others’  ideas  and  thoughts.  Researchers  have  discovered  that  materials recorded as annotations are more likely to be recalled compared to those not recorded (Aiken, Thomas et al. 1975). In a CLE, by reading and making annotations, participants collaboratively explore and exploit valuable ideas and knowledge. Experienced participants (e.g., experts and teachers)  may  also  provide  their  annotations  to  help  novices  understand  materials. Therefore,  annotations  can  be  considered  as  valuable  knowledge  in  a  CLE  and  thus require  effective  management.  In  recent  years,  a  number  of  shared  annotation provisioning  systems  have  been  developed  (Russell  2005),  represented  by  W3C’s Annotea  (W3C)  and  Microsoft’s  OneNote  (Microsoft  2007).  Meanwhile,  many researchers focus on standardizing annotation definition and description. The resulting formats  have  been  proposed  as  metadata  (Gašević,  Jovanović  et  al.  2007),  such  as Dublin  Core  (Initiative),  Learning  Object  Metadata  (LOM),  and  Shareable  Content Object Reference Model (SCORM). Our  research  aims  to  apply  the  latest  Semantic  Web  and  Web  services technologies  to  build  a  Web-based  social  software  tool  for  facilitating  knowledge sharing through multimedia annotation management in a CSCL group. In our previous work  (Yang,  Chen  et  al.  2004),  we  develop  a  personalized  annotation  management system  (PAMS)  1.0  as  our  kernel  system,  which  provides  a  cluster  of  system-level facilities (i.e., annotation creation, editing, and retrieval) for users to annotate a shared document at various granularities. In this paper, we report how we apply the Semantic Web  and  Web  services  technologies  to  build  a  Web-based  PAMS  2.0  featured  with extensibility and interoperability. We explain how we leverage PAMS 2.0 to facilitate knowledge sharing in a CSCL context. We have also designed and conducted a series of experiments  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  PAMS  2.0.  Specifically,  we  examine whether PAMS could help participants raise good questions and provide answers through the  practice  of  reading,  commenting,  reviewing,  and  discussion.  Our  experimental results  demonstrate  that  multimedia  annotation-based  collaboration  fa  cilitates knowledge  sharing  and  significantly  improves  participating  students’  reading comprehension. The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we  discuss related work. In Section 3 and 4, we discuss how we built PAMS 2.0 and how PAMS can be used to facilitate collaborative annotation management, respectively. In Section 5,  we  present  our  experiments  and  discuss  our  findings.  In  Section  6,  we  make conclusions.",

The schools were located in the city of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and its surrounding areas and were selected from a network of schools which all subscribed to a local organisation facilitating the schools computer networks. They were selected to represent schools with a diverse student population and from different socio-economic areas in the city. The teachers agreed to dedicate approximately 70 min a week for a period of 6 weeks of their regular lesson plan to implementing our programme. A total of 190 children participated in the CSCL discussions and completed the questionnaires. Nearly half of the children who participated had two parents born in countries other than the Netherlands. This implies that half of the participants were from minority backgrounds. 103 Students participated in the control group condition (53 girls, 50 boys; 49 immigrant students, 54 non-immigrant students) and 87 in the experimental group condition (45 girls, 42 boys; 40 immigrant students, 47 non-immigrant students). 3.3. Variables and Instruments The control and independent variables were measured as follows. For the programme a dummy variable was constructed, with the experimental programme receiving a score of 1 and the control pro- gramme receiving a score of 0 on this variable. Ability: IQ. The Standard Progressive Matrices test (60 items) was administered to determine general intellectual ability. Internal con- sistency reliability as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was 0.83 The socio-cultural background of the children was measured by asking the children in which country their parents were born. If both parents were born abroad, the children were considered to belong to a minority sociocultural background (mostly Moroccan and Turkish). Minority students received a score of 1 on the dummy variable; majority students received a score of 0. For gender, another dummy variable was constructed, with girls receiving a score of 1 and boys a score of 0 on this variable. Comprehensive reading was assessed by a Dutch standardised test (CITO) which is routinely administered in Dutch primary schools. General computer skills were determined before the lessons started by means of a questionnaire, on which the children could cross on a list of computer skill items which skills they thought they possessed (33 items, alpha = 0.90). The dependent variable, participation, was measured in three ways: 1. The number of words per message 2. The type of contributions (for quality of participation) 3. The proportion of elaborated contributions (for quality of participation) These measures were taken from two out of three Knowledge Forum discussions. It was decided to take the participation measures only from lesson two and three (the last two lessons in the lesson series) because the intervention needed some time to gain effect. The differ- ences in participation between the control and experimental programme were expected to begin to show in these last two lessons. (ad. 1) To measure students’ active participation, the number of words per message was used. The literature proposes different ways of measuring active participation. Usually, in these kinds of studies, the measure for participation is the number of contributions. Another measure which is used in research is the total number of words contributed. The number of words per message is another way to measure students’ active participation (see also Li, 2002; McConnell, 1997; Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 2001). In this study, the number of words per message is taken as a surface measure of the elaborateness of the contributions. Work by Hara, Bonk, and Angeli (2000) also supports this measure. They refer to lengthy messages as ‘‘one sign of depth to student electronic interaction” (p. 129). (ad. 2) The type of interactions students engage in provides more information on the quality of students’ participation. The type of par- ticipation was established by using a coding scheme similar to an instrument ﬁrst developed by Veldhuis-Diermanse (2002). The original",

We tested the motivational eﬃciency hypothesis, which pre- dicted that motivational beliefs, such as self-eﬃcacy and attributions to metacognitive strategy use are related to more eﬃcient problem solving. Findings suggested that self-eﬃcacy and metacognitive prompting increased problem-solving performance and eﬃciency separately through activation of reﬂection and strategy knowledge.

Participants completed a mathematical background inventory, and then assessed their self-eﬃcacy for mental multiplication accuracy, subsequently participants were ran- domly assigned to either a MP or control group, before solving a series of multiplication problems. Problem complexity was manipulated using two levels of math problems with each participant solving an equal number of problems at each complexity level. Hoﬀman & Schraw (2007) proposed the motivational eﬃciency hypothesis which states that positive motivational beliefs such as self-eﬃcacy (Bandura, 1986; Bandura, 1997; But- ler & Winne, 1995; Pintrich, 2000; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990), personal goal orientations (Ames & Archer, 1988; Stone, 2000), intrinsic motivation (Zimmerman, 1989), engage- ment and attributions to metacognitive strategy use (Butler & Winne, 1995; Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003) are related to more eﬃcient problem solving. We predicted individuals with powerful self-eﬃcacy beliefs judiciously dedicate resources and strategic knowledge towards the problem-solving process resulting in problem-solving eﬃciency. Our primary goal was to investigate the interaction between self-eﬃcacy and MP with regards to both accuracy and eﬃciency outcomes. We believe that higher degrees of self- eﬃcacy may interact with MP to produce superior accuracy, but reduced eﬃciency due to time considerations, for three inter-related reasons. One reason is that high self-eﬃcacy individuals use the most appropriate problem-solving strategy (Siegler; 1988; Walczyk, 1994), but exhibit more eﬀort (Chen, 2002) resulting in increased problem solving time. A second reason is individuals high in self-eﬃcacy exhibit mindfulness as a result of ded- icating more attention, exhibit a greater frequency of self-regulated learning, and respond favorably to MP. A third reason is that high self-eﬃcacy individuals experience fewer dis- tractions due to anxiety and handicapping (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Eysenck & Calvo, 1992; Hopko, Hunt, & Armento, 2005). We made several predictions regarding the relationship between self-eﬃcacy, MP, and problem complexity. First, we expected individuals with higher self-eﬃcacy to be respon- sive to MP, be more accurate solving math problems, and more accurate overall. A second prediction was that MP would interact with self-eﬃcacy. We expected MP to play a stron- ger role on accuracy and eﬃciency when self-eﬃcacy was high and when problems were more complex. Lastly, we expected MP to result in greater problem-solving accuracy.",

Grounded in the technology-mediated learning literature, this study presents a framework that addresses the relationship between the learner control and learning effec- tiveness, which contains four categories: learning achievement, self-efﬁcacy, satisfaction, and learning climate. In order to compare the learning effectiveness under traditional classroom and TVLE, we conducted a ﬁeld experiment. Data were collected from a junior high school of Taiwan. A total of 210 usable responses were analysed. We identiﬁed four results from this study.

In this study, a graphing calculator tutorial provided on the Casio FX1.0 and FX2.0 PLUS models was found to serve a fifth purpose, improving manipulative skills. Specifically, after using the tutorial, students in a beginning college algebra course scored significantly higher on a test on solving linear equations. Results concerning a change in attitudes were tentative, although they suggest that the tutorial also may contribute to improved attitudes.",

One of these was randomly selected as the experimental group and the other as the control group. Each class had an initial enrollment of 25 students. Information provided by the registrar’s office and a test of SAT scores confirmed that the two classes were roughly equivalent. The instructor also detected no difference between the abilities of the two classes, both of which she perceived as weak. However, she did think that the early start time (8:00 a.m.) for the experimental group caused them to take longer to focus on tasks. Use of the Casio FX2.0 tutorial was implemented in the experimental class, and students were shown how to use the tutorial early in the semester. The control group used the TI- 83 or TI-83 Plus, the calculator required of all students. Although students were allowed to use the Solve feature on the TI-83 or 83 Plus to check their work, use of this feature was not taught. The section on solving linear equations through symbolic manipulation lasted approximately 3 weeks. Students in the experimental group used the tutorial on a daily basis in class as the teacher lectured on step-by -step manipulation. They were also encouraged to use the tutorial while doing homework. Skill in solving linear equations was measured by a posttest given at the conclusion of the section on solving linear equations. The posttest consisted of 14 linear equations and two word problems that were solved with pencil and paper only; calculators were not permitted (see Appendix A ). Scoring of the problems was based on a rubric provided by the Educational Testing Service Network. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 4, with categories of algebraic knowledge, communication of this knowledge, and demonstration of the skills comprising the score. Scores of 3 or 4 represented successful responses, a 2 represented some conceptual understanding with inconsistent proficiency and incomplete explanations, and scores of 1 or 0 were deemed unsatisfactory. Scoring was done “blindly.”",

Whereas worked-out examples consist of a problem formulation, solution steps, and the ﬁnal solution, solved example problems merely provide the problem formulation and the solution. We employed a ﬁrst module of a computer-based environment for student teachers presenting solved exam- ple problems from which they learned how to select and to design worked-out examples for high school students. The participants (47 student teachers for German low- and medium-track schools and 33 student teachers for high-track schools) were randomly assigned to the cells of our 2 · 2 design (with vs. without self-explanation prompts; with vs. without instructional explanations). The eﬀects of the diﬀerent program versions on objective and subjective learning outcomes, on the perceived helpfulness of the program, and on the learning time were analyzed. As learning process data, the written and spoken self-explanations were assessed. The following main results were obtained: Particularly self-explanation prompts had favorable eﬀects on learning outcomes, whereas instructional explanations can reduce the student teacher(cid:1)s self-expla- nation activities and thereby the learning outcomes. Whereas ‘‘objectively’’ the most favorable learning out- comes were obtained when only self-explanation prompts were employed, the student teachers perceived their learning outcome best when only instructional explanations were provided. It can be concluded that the status of self-explanation prompts and of instructional explanations is comparable irrespective of the example type presented for learning. (cid:1) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Adolescent  participants  between  the  ages  of  15  and  17 were recruited from families who responded to the request for  participation  in  the  study.  Four  participants  met  the following criteria for participation: (a) verbal intelligence quotient of 80 or more as measured by the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Tests (K-BIT; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990), (b)  a  reading  and  math  level  of  at  least  third  grade  as determined  by  the  Letter-Word  Identification,  Passage Comprehension,  Calculation,  and  Applied  Problems subtests  of  the  Woodcock–Johnson  Psycho-Educational Battery  Tests  of  Achievement  III  (WJ-III;  Woodcock, McGrew,  &  Mather,  2001),  (c)  a  diagnosis  of  SBM  (the most  severe  form  of  spina  bifida),  and  (d)  evidence  of shunted hydrocephalus within the child’s first year. The reliability of the K-BIT IQ composite ranges from .88 to .98 across ages. Bands of error for standard scores for the participants in this study at a 90% confidence interval resulted in a standard error of measurement around the indi- vidual’s true score of ±6. Maria obtained a composite score on the K-BIT of 76 with a confidence interval score of 70 to 82. Given that her “true” score falls within this range, she was  included  in  the  study.  The  WJ-III  subtests  have  reli- abilities of .80 or higher. Parents contacted their child’s doctor to request the med- ical history including the type (i.e., meningocele, myelome- ningocele) and location of the lesion (i.e., cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral) of the neural defect as well as information regarding  the  child’s  neurological  status  (e.g.,  history  of hydrocephalus,  shunt  revisions,  infections,  etc.)  and  then completed a questionnaire about the child’s medical history. Past  medical  records  for  one  participant  born  outside  the United States were unavailable, so no information regard- ing a specific neural anomaly (i.e., Arnold–Chiari II malfor- mation)  is  provided.  In  addition,  each  child’s  cumulative school records were reviewed to examine the participant’s current  individualized  education  plan  (IEP)  and  resultant academic and behavioral goals.

Score-level analysis, however, may fail to reflect subtle changes that might be evident at the item level. This article demonstrates a method for studying item-level changes using data from a multiwave experiment with a teaching method called enhanced anchored instruction (EAI). The analysis combines a mixture Rasch model for detecting individual differences within latent groups with a latent transition analysis model for tracking changes in latent group membership over the course of EAI. The analysis clearly indicates the effects of EAI and how they differ for members of each latent class. Comparisons are provided with a standard analysis of changes in test scores. Implications of the new approach are discussed for detecting subtle transformations in the math performance of students across a range of ability levels.",

        "participants": " Participants. Complete data sets of test scores from stu- dents  (N  =  109)  in  six  seventh-grade  mathematics  class- rooms  were  drawn  from  the  host  study  for  use  in  this reanalysis. Four classes of students were typically achiev- ing,  one  class  was  high  achieving  (pre-algebra),  and  one inclusive class consisted of 13 students with an Individual- ized Education Program (IEP; 12 students with LD) and 13 typically  achieving  students.  Two  math  teachers  (MT1, MT2)  each  taught  three  90-minute  classes  per  day.  MT1 taught  a  class  of  typically  achieving  students,  the  pre- algebra class, and the inclusive class. To be included in the pre-algebra  class,  students  achieved  at  or  above  the  90th percentile  on  the  state  math  test,  posted  high  scores  on teacher-made  tests,  and  demonstrated  excellence  on  daily assignments. In the inclusive class, students with IEPs qual- ified for special education services according to criteria set by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (2006). That  is,  students  with  LD  had  a  significant  discrepancy equal to or greater than 1.75 standard errors of the estimate below expected achievement based on individually admin- istered,  standardized  achievement  and  ability  tests.  They received special education services an average of 635 min- utes per week (range = 300–920). Mean national percentile (NP) ranks on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS; Hoover, Dunbar, & Frisbie, 2001) administered as pretests immedi- ately  prior  to  intervention  confirmed  these  students’  low math achievement: NP = 15 in math computation and NP = 14 in problem solving. Based on pretest results of the ITBS, MT1’s three classes differed in computation and in problem solving. Pre-algebra students outscored students in the typical classes in computa- tion  and  problem  solving,  and  students  in  the  typical  class scored higher than students in the inclusive class in both com- putation and problem solving. MT2’s typical classes did not differ in computation or in problem solving, nor were there differences between the four typical classes (one of MT1 and three of MT2) in computation or in problem solving. EAI. Between Time Point 2 (Pretest 2) and Time Point 3 (posttest) teachers taught two EAI modules to students in all  six  classes.  EAI  is  a  form  of  anchored  instruction,  a teaching  approach  made  popular  by  the  Cognition  and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (1990, 1997). EAI consists of one overarching problem comprised of several subprob- lems presented in a multimedia format. After this problem is  solved,  students  work  in  small  groups  on  an  applied, hands-on  problem  that  requires  the  same  skill  set  as  the multimedia-based problem. EAI shares common core char- acteristics  with  problem-based  learning  (Barrows,  1996), which is often used in medical education (Gijbels, Dochy, Van den Bossche, & Segers, 2005). For example, instruc- tors  lead  discussions  with  interesting  questions,  students work together in small groups to develop and test solutions to  the  problems,  and  instructors  provide  explicit  skill instruction as needed. Learning scaffolds embedded in the EAI problems provide students with multiple opportunities to practice their skills in varied contexts, which is important for skills and concepts transfer (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Greeno & the Middle School Mathematics Through Applications Project Group, 1998). The multimedia-based problem used in the host study is called “Fraction of the Cost” (FOC) and stars three students from a middle school. One actor is a girl with Down syn- drome  whose  parents  encouraged  her  participation  and helped  her  rehearse  her  lines.  The  video  was  filmed  at  a local skateboarding store and in a computer room, garage, and backyard of a local home. The teens study a schematic plan of a skateboard ramp and then discuss how they can afford to build a ramp with the materials and money they have available. To solve the problem, students need to (a) calculate the percentage of money in a savings account and sales tax on a purchase, (b) read a tape measure, (c) convert feet to inches, (d) decipher building plans, (e) construct a table of materials, (f) compute mixed fractions, (g) estimate and  compute  combinations,  and  (h)  calculate  total  cost. Several instructional modules supported teaching, learning, and assessment (see Figures 1 and 2).",

Participant se- lection  was  based  on  several  criteria.  First, participants  had been  previously  identified  as  learning  disabled  by  meeting Pennsylvania State criteria for learning disabilities, which stip- ulate that a child must demonstrate (a) a chronic condition of presumed  neurological  origin  that  selectively  interferes  with the development, integration, or demonstration of language or nonverbal abilities; (b) a severe discrepancy between achieve- ment and intellectual ability in one or more of several areas (i.e., oral  expression, listening  comprehension, written  ex- pression, basic reading skills, reading comprehension, mathe- matics calculation, and mathematics reasoning), which is not correctable  without  special  education  and  related  services; (c) specific deficits in receptive and expressive language and deficiencies  in  initiating  or  sustaining  attention, impulsivity, and other specific conceptual and thinking difficulties; (d) nor- mal or above-normal intelligence; and (e) learning problems that are not due primarily to other disabling conditions or en- vironmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage. This deter- mination was made by a full assessment and comprehensive report by a certified school psychologist. A summary of par- ticipating  students’ characteristics  is  presented  in Table  1.  It must be noted that although the sample in this study was iden- tified as learning disabled, whether these students had learn- ing disabilities in mathematics is questionable according to the conventional cutoff scores for a mathematics disability (a dis- crepancy of at least 1 standard deviation between their scores on a standardized test of mathematics and their full scale score on an intelligence test). Only Percy and possibly Tony would fit this definition of having a learning disability in mathemat- ics (i.e., a discrepancy existed between their IQs and each of the  math  composite  and  numerical  operations  scores  on  the WIAT, but  their  math  reasoning  scores  were  in  the  average range). Second, a teacher interview indicated that these students were  experiencing  significant  difficulties  with  mathematical problem solving, an area that was specifically targeted for in- struction on each student’s Individualized Education Program goals. However, the teacher reported that all students had suc- cessfully passed a criterion test of mathematics computation skills involving all four operations. In addition, each student had to complete a sample of six one-step multiplication and division word problems similar to the criterion tests used in the  study. An  examination  of  word  problems  completed  (see Table 1) indicated that all four students experienced significant difficulties  solving  them;  they  had  not  reached  the  mastery (less than 50%) needed to solve more complex word problems. In this study, the special education teacher conducted all testing and instruction in the learning support classroom. She was certified to teach students with mental and physical dis- abilities and had 12 years’ teaching experience. At the time of the study, the teacher was completing her master’s degree in special education.",

The exercises and assignments cover important topics determined after an analysis of topics that are often taught in different universities. During the exer- cises, students reengineer the general purpose discrete event simulator named SLEEP (Simulation, Logic, Execution, prEsentation, Physics). A multilayer organization of the SLEEP simulator enables coverage of the important topics in a coherent manner. In order to support parallel execution in SLEEP students start to reengineer the simulator layers with an exercise related to concurrent programming, followed by two exercises related to distributed programming, and ﬁnish with an exercise related to grid computing. The exercises follow the principles of error management training and teach students what common errors are and how to overcome them. The article also describes a practical experience with the use of SLEEP on a concurrent and distributed programming course over a 3-year period. The results show a positive impact on both students’ satisfaction and performance. (cid:1) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Undergraduate students (N = 123) were randomly assigned to one of three scaffolding conditions (adaptive  content  and  process  scaffolding  [ACPS],  adaptive  process  scaffolding  [APS],  and  no scaffolding [NS]) and were trained to use a hypermedia environment to learn about the circulatory system.  The  product  data  revealed  that  the  students  in  the  ACPS  condition  gained  significantly more  declarative  knowledge  than  did  those  in  the  other  two  comparison  conditions.  In  addition, ACPS was statistically significantly associated with qualitative shifts in the students’ mental mod- els of the topic, whereas the other two conditions were not. The verbal protocol data revealed that students in the ACPS condition utilized only a few regulatory processes, engaged in help-seeking behavior,  and  relied  on  the  tutor  to  regulate  their  learning.  By  contrast,  the  verbal  protocol  data indicated that learners in the APS condition regulated their learning by using several key monitor- ing activities and learning strategies, while those in the NS condition were less effective at regulat- ing  their  learning  and  used  fewer  key  self-regulatory  processes  during  the  activity.

        "abstract": " Abstract Concept maps have been widely employed for helping students organise their knowledge as well as evaluating their knowledge structures in a wide range of subject matters. Although researchers have recognised concept maps as being an important educational tool, past experiences have also revealed the difﬁculty of evaluating the correctness of a concept map. It usually takes days or weeks for teachers to manually evaluate the concept maps developed by students; consequently, the students cannot receive timely feedback from the teachers, which not only affects their learning schedules, but also signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the students’ learning achievements. In this paper, a computer- based concept map-oriented learning strategy with real-time assessment and feedback is proposed in order to cope with the problems mentioned above. Our approach provides immediate evaluation of concept maps and gives also real-time feedback to the students. An experiment has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this new strategy in comparison with the conventional computer-based concept map approach. It is found that our innovative approach can be signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial to promote learning achievements as well as the learning attitudes of students.",

A logistic regression model predicted user performance in relation to a skill categorization task with 75 % accuracy. The manner in which users apply the skills that are acquired is then assessed through a rule-based reasoning system that allows the pedagogical agent to adapt instruction. The results show that the model allows the agent to detect instances when skills are inappro- priately applied as well as what type of goal that is pursued by students. We discuss the implications of these user-modelling techniques in terms of sequencing instructional content and using the tutoring agent to deliver several types of discourse moves in order to enhance learning.",

        "participants": " Participants Twenty-two undergraduate students from McGill University (6 men and 15 women) with an average GPA of 3.3 (SD = 0.52; on a 4.0 scale) participated in the study. Participants were recruited through a classiﬁed ad posted on the university website. The following inclusion criteria were chosen to sample the participants in this study, based on the student population that is targeted by the design guidelines of the MHRt (i.e., version 1.1): (a) participants had to be native English speakers, (b) not currently enrolled in any history related program, and (c) unfamiliar with the topic to be learned (i.e., the Acadian Deportation, 1755–1763). Participants were compensated $10 per hour for taking part in the study. Historical topic and source documents Causal chain of events in relation to the topic Students studied the circumstances of a council meeting held in Halifax, in July 1755, where Governor Charles Lawrence gave the order to deport Acadians (see Faragher 2005). Researchers revised the narrative text that described the council meeting by excluding any information in regards to the causes and contributing factors that explained why Governor Charles Lawrence made the decision to begin the deportation. In doing so, the events referred to in the text were represented as a causal chain of events through the use of a replicable and principled method of discourse analysis (Fig. 1; see Montanero and Lucero 2011; Poitras et al. 2012). The chain of events in relation to the Acadian Deportation included 11 causal episodes and 12 links. The causal links were categorized by researchers as consisting of an intentional relationship (motive, desire, or goal that led to the event), a temporal relationship (chronologically ordered series of events), or a causal relationship (inﬂuential factors that explain why an event occurred). The causal episodes were reviewed and edited by two researchers until consensus was reached. The text was then edited so that no inﬂuential factors were apparent. This was done to induce confusion through knowledge deﬁcit (see Lehman et al. 2012) in order to allow students to develop the SRL skills that are essential to manage and resolve these instances of confusion. Source documents in relation to the topic Students investigated the causes of the Acadian Deportation by analyzing six written and two pictorial sources. Half of these sources were primary sources, written by eye-witness accounts of the actual event, and the other half consisted of secondary sources that were written much later after the event had occurred and based on other accounts. The primary sources consisted of a letter and a memorial addressed to the Governor written by the",

Popular features of paper texts are: portable, easy to take notes, and its ﬂexible sizes (Morris, Brush, & Meyers, 2007). These features make the application of paper texts still popular in the digitalized wave. The use of paper texts facilitates student partici- pation in group collaboration (van Boxtel, van der Linden, & Kanselaar, 2000). However, students often encounter comprehension difﬁculties when reading complicated materials or technical terms presented in paper texts. As a result, the students’ learning motivation to complete the assigned learning tasks is reduced. For the last decade, researchers have argued that paper is a universal resource which can be integrated with digital technologies, such as mobile phones, to support learning activities (Chao & Chen, 2009; Luff & Heath, 1998; Perry, O’Hara, Sellen, Brown, & Happer, 2001; Pettit & KuKulska-Hulme, 2007). A paper-plus-smartphone learning context could beset up to facilitate students’ collaborative learning perfor- mance. The integration of smartphones and paper-based materials help to enhance individual and group learning outcomes along with facilitating more interactive discussions among group members. Learners can use camera-equipped smartphones and installed code reading software to access information contained after scanning and decoding the QR (Quick Response) code, a type of two-dimensional barcode. The integration of paper-based materials and QR codes enable students to learn based on their individual learning styles and learning pace (Leone & Leo, 2011). Furthermore, students can summarize related information or answer speciﬁc questions embedded within the QR codes on a mobile device (i.e., smartphone, personal digital assistant). Typing information or comments on a mobile device provides students with an opportunity to refer back to what they read or review their thoughts during the learning process. Finally, students would beneﬁt from re-using these information resources on their own mobile devices to achieve their learning goals. The instructor provides appropriate guidance or support to help students solve problems they encounter during learning process (Mayer, 2004). Once students solve problems successfully, their learning outcomes will be enhanced. Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976) suggested that * Corresponding author. Tel.: þ886 7 5252510; fax: þ886 7 5254799.

Our hypothesis is that sociocognitive systems, such as those needed for collaborative inquiry  and  reflective  learning,  can  best  be  understood  as  a  community  of  interacting  agents, who each have expertise in accomplishing particular high-level goals.  We introduce a system, named  SCI-WISE,  that  houses  a  community  of  software  agents,  such  as  a  Planner,  a Collaborator,  and  an  Assessor.    The  agents  give  strategic  advice  and  guide  students  as  they undertake  collaborative  research  projects  and  as  they  reflect  on  and  revise  their  inquiry processes.  Students can easily modify SCI-WISE so that it expresses their own theories of how to do inquiry and how best to coach and scaffold the process.  We describe curricular activities in which middle school students use SCI-WISE to engage in “inquiry about inquiry,” thereby making  inquiry  and  metacognition  topics  of  investigation.

        "abstract": " Abstract Research  on  techniques  for  teaching  computer  programming  to  novice  learners  has  suggested  that introducing  programming  concepts  and  theories  is  extremely  difficult  because  the  learners  have  to  assimilate syntactical  methods  of  the  programming  language  as  well  as  their  interface  to  the  programming  world.  Computer programming for the novice requires the understanding of a variety of different areas such as logic and mathematical concepts,  syntax,  the  language  interface,  algorithms,  flowcharts,  and  pseudocode  associated  with  programming theory, which can overwhelm the learner and increase levels of stress and frustration (cognitive load). The central theme  of  this  research  was  to  examine  the  effects  of  scaffolding  tools  on  cognitive  load  levels  as  participants completed laboratory assignments within a Visual Basic for Applications programming course, and to compare final course grades in Phase I and Phase II of the research. Participants were asked to evaluate their cognitive load as they completed assignments throughout the course. Course grades were also collected because all students in Phase I of the research eventually received the scaffolding tool prior to the final exam. Phase I of this study showed that within the major groups of online and face-to-face learners, and the subgroups of treatment and control, some benefit (as determined  by  the  statistical  means)  was  obtained  by  the  use  of  the  scaffolding  tool  to  reduce  cognitive  load  and improve laboratory scores. In the second phase of this research the students did not receive the scaffolding tool. A comparison of Phase I and Phase II indicates that the Group with the Scaffolding Tool (Phase I) experienced lower levels of cognitive load and attained higher laboratory and course scores than did the Group without the Scaffolding Tool.",

The scaffolding is tailored to the student’s needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated soft- ware, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy.

In this article, we describe a learning environment to help pre-service teachers in Singapore solve ill-structured problems. There are four key dimensions in our learning environment: tutor-led face-to-face tutorial, face-to-face discussion among participants, asynchronous online discussion, and a reflection log. The goal of this study was to investigate the roles of asyn- chronous online discussion and reflection logs in supporting ill-structured problem solving. Findings indicated that the use of asynchronous online discussion in an Asian context appears to mainly support two types of ill-structured problem solving processes, “Articulate the problem space” and “Generate possible problem solutions,” while the reflection log seems to facilitate the processes of “Assessing the viability of alternative solu- tions” and “Monitor the problem space and solution options.” The pre- service teachers’ perceptions on using the asynchronous online discussion and reflection log were also reported.",

Research has highlighted that participants have become better at critiquing, questioning, analyzing, making connections, and extending the content beyond the classroom through the use of asynchronous online discussion forums (Williams et al., 2001). There are now many software packages that offer platforms for asynchronous online discussions. These include BlackBoard, an off-the-shelf, integrated online delivery and management system for faculty members and students to use, and Knowledge Forum. In this study, the pre-service teachers made use of the Communication Centre of the BlackBoard software for the asynchronous online discussion activities. EVALUATING ILL-STRUCTURED PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS / 205 The online discussion in our study ran for two weeks. During the discussion, the pre-service teachers posted their hypermedia design projects onto the Web and gave constructive comments, suggestions, or questions about each other’s project. They also posted their subsequent responses to these comments. The purpose for the online discussion was thus twofold: 1. To provide each pre-service teacher an opportunity to identify design problems of their classmates’ projects and give suggestions to solve the problems. Each group would therefore receive feedback about their own projects. 2. To give each group of pre-service teachers the opportunity to evaluate the comments and suggestions they received and respond to these. Whenever a pre-service teacher posted a message, the new message would be added to the discussion in a manner which showed the relationship of the new response to the existing online discussion messages. This helped the pre-service teachers to follow the threads of discussion easily. The criteria on which the pre-service teachers’ participation in the asynchronous online discussion would be judged, which were 10% of their final grade in the course, were discussed in class prior to the commencement of the actual discussion. The criteria were as follows: post at least one comment, suggestion, or question about someone else’s hypermedia project; incorporate ideas or concepts gathered from the face-to-face tutorials and assigned readings; and articulate well-reasoned positions. Since the omnipresence of the tutor or instructor’s continual monitoring of message postings can be inherently oppressive to certain students and ideas, and yet to remove oneself completely may abdicate responsibility for overseeing a required learning activity (Fauske & Wade, 2003-2004), the tutor in our study only participated in the following manner: answered any pre-service teachers’ questions that were specifically directed to the tutor and posted instructions at the very onset of the online discussion to help the pre-service teachers remember the specific tasks they had to do. Hence, the entire online discussion was very much controlled by the pre-service teachers. Questions, prompts, comments, and suggestions were generated freely by the participants.",

The application consists of four main compo- nents—the module for interactive sorting, the scaffolding module, the motivational module, and the graphical user interface module, each with a distinct role of helping students in learning sorting algorithms. Our re- search methodology included data collection with administered two surveys, collected exam results and recorded application usage data. Analysis of the collected data shows our approach is an effective way of learning sorting algorithms. (cid:1) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The primary goal  is to improve the performance of the existing e-learning system  where  group adaptation is applied. The proposed method includes an integration of information, processes, applications and human resources in the e-learning system. Integration is based on a web application we developed for managing the learning environment. The application enables an integration of the Moodle, the OpenLDAP directory  for managing user accounts, and the OpenNebula toolkit for managing a cloud computing infrastructure. The major advantage  of  the  suggested  approach  is  that  the  existing  system  for  adaptive  e-learning  does  not  need  any changes, while it becomes more available and suitable for ubiquitous learning.

Moreover, combining narration with the visual presence of an animated pedagogical agent may also encourage students to process information deeper than narration or on-screen text alone. The current study was designed to evaluate three eﬀects among students learning about the human cardiovascular system: the modality eﬀect (narration vs. on-screen text), the embodied agent eﬀect (narration + agent vs. on-screen text), and the image eﬀect (narration + agent vs. narration). The results of this study document large and signiﬁcant embodied agent and image eﬀects on the posttest (particularly retention items) but surprisingly no modality eﬀect was found. Overall, the results sug- gest that incorporating an animated pedagogical agent – programmed to coordinate narration with gaze and pointing – into a science-focused multimedia learning environment can foster learning.

Participants and design Fifty-one undergraduate students (15 males and 36 females; M = 19.6 years of age, SD = 2.34; GPA M = 3.29, SD = 0.44) enrolled in several educational technology courses at a large public Q. Dunsworth, R.K. Atkinson / Computers & Education 49 (2007) 677–690 681 university located in the Southwest of the United States participated in the study. All students were volunteers in this study and received course credits for participation. The design of the pres- ent study was a single independent variable comparison with three levels. The participants were randomly assigned in equal proportions (N = 17) to one of the three computer-based conditions: on-screen text, narration, or narration + agent. 3.2. Computer-based leaning environment The six-lesson computer-based instruction was developed using Macromedia Director MX (Macromedia, 2003) with instructional content adapted from a study by Chi, Siler, Jeong, Yama- uchi, and Hausmann (2001) involving learning from human tutoring in the context of instruction on the human circulatory system. To make the instructions more self-explanatory in the multime- dia environment, the original 86 sentences were re-organized into a sequence of six lessons: Lesson 1 – Circulatory System; Lesson 2 – The Heart Structure; Lesson 3 – Bloodﬂow in the Heart; Lesson 4 – Oxygen and Oxygenation; Lesson 5 – Vessels; Lesson 6 – Diﬀusion. A number of the original Chi et al. sentences were modiﬁed in order to keep the lessons concise or to make the connection between lessons more ﬂuent. Within each lesson, the visuals on screen included colorful still images and animations. They were created for this multimedia environment and were relevant to the instructional content on page. Navigation of the lessons was sequential from Lesson 1 to Lesson 6 and no lesson could be skipped. Within each lesson, the learners had the choice to advance to the next screen, replay the current screen (simultaneously with the audio clip if any), or go back to the previous screen. The learners were aﬀorded as much time as they wanted to process the information on each screen. The learning environment contained a number of features that did not vary across conditions, including (1) its size, which was 800 · 600 pixels; (2) a listing of all six lessons, with the current les- son highlighted (see right side of Fig. 1); (3) navigational aid, indicating what lesson the learner was in (e.g., ‘‘Circulatory System’’), the total number of pages (or screens) in the lesson, and the current page (e.g., ‘‘Page 3 of 8’’); (4) a control panel containing a back button, a replay button, and a next button that enabled the learner to move back a single screen, replay the current screen (including animation and, for those conditions with it, narration), or move to the next screen, respectively (see bottom middle of Fig. 1); and (5) a glossary, containing 38 words with there deﬁnitions (see top right of Fig. 1). The text box that appears on Fig. 1 was only visible in the on-screen text condition. The learning environment was conﬁgurable to run in one of three instructional modes corre- sponding to the three conditions used in the present experiment. All three versions of the com- puter-based learning environment contained exactly the same instructional information, including the same 53 screens. In the on-screen text mode, the learners were presented with all of the instructional content as text, that appeared just to the right of the colorful visuals (see",

Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a general purpose pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation Web-based learning system called Health Information Network Teaching System (HINTS) to further facilitate students’ learning and thereby make the HINTS a more helpful educational tool. Our focus is the design of the general purpose pedagogical architecture and its implementation in a multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. A preliminary students’ performance evaluation result is also reported. We analyzed how to evaluate the students’ performance and how the hints were given by the pedagogical agent. The system has been installed in the National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan for trial purposes. Some experiments have been conducted and the results have shown that the pedagogical agent indeed help the students in their learning process.",

We examined the cognitive and the motivational consequences of guidance and freedom in a learning environment used by students learning introductory programming. Students worked with one of three interactive learning environments that varied in the amount of freedom to explore or guidance provided. The Guided group solved a set of assigned problems worked with a tutoring system (GIL) that interrupts and provides explanatory feed- back whenever students make mistakes. An Exploratory group worked on the same problems using an exploration-oriented version of the system that does not interrupt upon errors, but instead enables students to test ideas and receive feedback at their request. A Free group used the same exploratory learning system but was free to generate their own tasks. The tutorial guidance helped students solve the assigned problems more quickly, although there were no differences in the subjects' under- standing of programming constructs or their ability to construct programs. However, both discovery learning groups were more effective in detecting bugs in programs, presumably due to their experiences finding and repairing their own errors. For students required to solve assigned problems, the positive or negative nature of the learning environment's motivational consequences appeared to depend upon the rel- ative ability of the student. The learning environments differentially affected the attitudes of high and low ability students toward the domain and their assessments of the success of their performance. Low ability students in the discovery learning situation tended to exhibit more negative judgments about their performance and the computer's assistance than comparable students who received tutoring. In con- trast, high ability students tended to exhibit somewhat more positive opinions of their performance in the discovery learning environment than comparable students in the tutoring situation. We argue that discovery learning creates more opportuni- ties for students to assess how well they can overcome obstacles, and their resulting attitudes toward their past and future success in the domain relies heavily on this type of attribution. The positive or negative nature of that attribution will depend on their relative success in achieving their goals.",

Selective Analysis of Perception Word assoda tion Concept+ame/alike, three picture word matching Concept4fferent, three picture word matching Five student speech-language clinicians were trained to use the Words & Concepts series in two of  three conditions. The first condition, software with enhancement, represented a context in which assisted performance was used to enable children to assume increasingly greater control for problem solving and task completion. In this condition, the interactive context involved the clinician asking questions, explaining information, prompting, modeling, and encourag- ing verbalization of  children‘s responses to all questions asked by the computer and/or  the clinician. In the second condition, software alone, instruction was solely from the software program. The clinician was present only to ensure that children in this condition spent anequivalent amount of  time with the computer program as those children in condition 1. To accomplish this, clinicians encour- aged children to  listen and point  to appropriate pictures,  and/or  to  repeat 22 Schetz and Stremmel questions asked by  the  computer if children were not  listening or  did  not respond. In  the third  condition, the control condition, the students received language enrichment from their regular classroom instruction only. The Head Start children in conditions 1 and 2 were also exposed to the routine language enrichment of  the Head Start classroom except during the computer training. The Head Start curriculum stressed the promotion of  language development by making language an integral part of  all daily activities. Clinicians provided computer instruction for 20 minutes, twice per week for  12 weeks  (24  sessions) for children in the software conditions (software alone, and software with enhancement). During regular morning Head Start classroom activities, children were paired when possible and taken to another room for computer instruction. During the computer sessions, clinicians kept anecdotal records, which included comments relating to the training procedures and examples of  the spontaneous language of  the students. This information, along with information about the specific training procedures that were used in the software with the enhancement condition as opposed to the software- alone condition, provides evidence for a Vygotskian perspective on computer implementation. This aspect is reported below. Evidence for a Vygotskian Perspective Structured software was chosen in order to make efficient use of  the time spent at the computer for the improvement of  discourse skills. Comments by researchers in  early  childhood point  to  the need  to  maximize the  learning process by matching computer environments and children’s needs (Clements, Nastasi, & Swaminathan, 1993). Using this  type of  software, as opposed to discovery-oriented software, provided more examples and thus more practice for the students to learn how to respond appropriately to questions, the essence of  discourse skills. The software, Words  & Concepts series, requires a pointing response. However, discourse skills require a student to understand and be able to orally answer questions. The condition, software with enhancement, was introduced to address this need. Because children in this condition were required to express their responses as well as point to the correct response, it was necessary to have scaffolding from the clinicians to assist students in achieving these objectives. The Scaffolding Process It is important in the scaffolding process that the child be given increasing responsibility for the task and not merely that the task be simplified (Greenfield, 1984). The task for children in the software-with-enhancement condition was to verbalize their responses along with pointing - a pointing response being the only  requirement of  the  computer software. Although  some children were reticent and some found the task difficult, clinicians were instructed to contin- ually encourage the children to verbalize their responses. For example, when from’’ in the activity word the computer asked  “Find  the  one you",

        "participants": " participants  in  a  discussion  try  to  elaborate  the  mutual  belief  that  their  partner  has understood what they meant to a criterion sufficient for the current purpose (Clark and Brennan, 1991). For Vygotsky, inner speech has a functional similarity with social speech but loses its structural similarity. For Luria (1969), \"inner speech necessarily ceases to be detailed and grammatical\" (p. 143). The difference between social and inner speech is due to the fact that \"inner speech is just the ultimate point in the continuum of communicative conditions  judged  by  the  degree  of  'intimacy'  between  the  addresser  and  addressee\" (Kozulin, 1990, p. 178). The main transformation observed as a result of the intimacy between  the  addresser  and  addressee  is  a  process  of  abbreviation  (Kozulin,  1990; Wertsch,  1979,  1991).  Interestingly,  Krauss  and  Fussell  (1991)  found  the  same abbreviation phenomena in social grounding. They report several experiments in which subjects  have  to  establish  expressions  to  refer  to  'non  sense  figures'  and  to  use  these references later on, in various conditions. Subjects first refer to a particular picture by saying \"Looks  like  a  Martini  glass  with  legs  on  each  side\".  Later  on,  this  reference becomes \"Martini glass with the legs\", then \"Martini glass shaped thing\", then \"Martini glass\" and finally \"Martini\". Krauss and Fussell show that the decrease in expression length  is  a  function  of  the  feed-back  given  by  the  listener.  Another  interesting experiment  compares  expressions  built  by  the  subjects  for  themselves  or  for  peers. They observe  that  personal  messages  were  less  than  half  as  long  as  social  messages. Why does abbreviation occur both during internalization and during social grounding? The explanation may be that internalization and social grounding are two phenomena during  which  the  addresser  acquires  information  about  the  addressee's  understanding of his messages. The work on grounding is very important for designers of ILEs, it is even at the heart of recent debates in artificial intelligence. The symbol grounding crisis (Harnad, 1990) launched intensive research to design situated robots (Maes, 1990), i.e.  robots  which can  physically  ground  their  symbols  in  the  environment,  through  actors  and  sensors. Less attention has been paid to the possibility of social grounding, i.e. grounding the system  symbols  in  the  user's  experience.  Any  communication  is  ambiguous,  it  works because  humans  constantly  detect  and  repair  communication  breakdowns,  but computers  have  far  fewer  resources  than  humans  for  detecting  and  repairing communication failures (Suchman, 1987). Previous sections placed great expectations on the cognitive benefits of using graphical languages, but how do we guarantee that learners  correctly  interpret  these  symbols?  Wenger  (1987)  defined  the  epistemic fidelity  of  a  representation  as  the  degree  of  consistency  between  the  physical representation  of  some  phenomena  and  the  expert's  mental  representation  of  this phenomena.  Roschelle  (1990)  attempted  to  apply  this  principle  to  the  design  of  the Envisioning Machine (EM), a direct-manipulation graphical simulation of the concepts of velocity and acceleration. He successively designed several representations for the same set of physical phenomena (particle movements). The first EM design focused on epistemic  fidelity.  However,  because  mapping  physical  and  mental  representations  is an inherently ambiguous interpretation process, the users did not read representations as experts did. Representations do not hold some trivial meaning but, inversely, can be used  to  support  social  grounding.  Roschelle  (1992)  observed  that  learners  use  the computer  to  test  under  increasingly  tighter  constraints  the  degree  to  which  their interpretation of physical phenomena were shared. Roschelle refers to this property of representations as 'symbolic mediation'. Two  implications  can  be  derived.  The  first  has  been  quoted  before:  collaboration should  be  concerned  with  what  is  happening  on  the  screen  (not  some  hidden knowledge), since the screen is  the  main  reference  to  establish  shared  meanings  (see section  4.2).  The  second  implication  is  that  dialogue  should  be  more  about understanding than about agreement. In PEOPLE POWER, our dialogue patterns were rudimentary,  including  only  agreement  or  disagreement.  This  indicates  a  Piagetian bias. Doise and Mugny (1984) have extended the notion of conflict between a subject's beliefs  and  the  world  events  to  include  conflict  between  opposite  beliefs  held  by different  subjects.  This  socio-cognitive  conflict  is  more  likely  to  be  perceived  and solved because of the social pressure to maintain partnership. However, in her thesis, Blaye  (1988)  found  very  little  evidence  of  real  conflict  in  pairs.  The  concept  of conflict  is  not  operationally  defined.  Where  is  the  frontier  between  a  divergence  of focus (Miyake, 1986), some disagreement (Blaye, 1988) and an open conflict? There is  no  clear  answer  to  that  question.  Actually,  disagreement  in  itself  seems  to  be  less important than the fact that it generates communication between peer members (Blaye, 1988; Gilly, 1989). Bearison et al. (1986, quoted by Blaye, 1988) reported that non- verbal disagreement (manifested for instance by moving  the  object  positioned  by  the partner)  was  not  predictive  of  post-test  score  increase.  Blaye  (1988)  suggests  that \"oppositions  give  rise  to  verbalizations  that  regulate  the  partner's  activities  and  may possibly  contribute  to  the  internalization,  by  the  producer,  of  an  adequate  regulation mode.\"4 (p. 398). The notion of conflict results from a bipolarisation of the continuum which  goes  from  a  total  absence  of  understanding  to  fully  shared  understanding. Collaboration among agents should not be simplified to agreement or disagreement. It should  be  considered  a  complex  social  grounding  process.  Of  course,  artificial intelligence handles dialogue moves such as \"continue\" or \"refute\" more easily than it encodes  meanings.  Intermediate  solutions  could  be  to  extend  richer  sets  of  dialogue moves  able  to  generate  sub-dialogues  aiming  to  elaborate,  disambiguate  or  repair communication  (Baker,  1992).  The  person-machine  interface  must  have  some  'noise tolerance', some space where the meaning of concepts can be negotiated. Some  recent  experiments  with  MEMOLAB  (Dillenbourg  et  al.,  1993)  revealed mechanisms  of  human-machine  grounding:  the  learner  perceives  how  the  machine understands  him  (i.e.  he  makes  a  diagnosis  of  the  machine  diagnosis)  and  reacts  in order  to  correct  eventual  misdiagnosis.  However,  in  the  current  implementation  of",

In contrast to the first graduate class, discussions in this class were actively moderated by the instructor, who stimulated the discussion through questions and advice. The number of students in the latter discussions ranged from four to six. The resulting number of messages, for both classes combined, was 44. The data were coded according to the cognitive presence model; 8% of the data were coded as triggering, 42% as exploration, 13% as integration, and 4% as resolution. Garrison et al. (2001) hypothesized that the low number of messages found at the integration and resolution stages was probably due to the lack of reflection time, and that students were reluctant to share and test their solutions for fear of criticism. Greenlaw and DeLoach (2003) and DeLoach and Greenlaw (2003)10 examined critical thinking spillover in electronic discussions. They hypothesized that a message that would be coded high on the critical thinking taxonomy would be followed by further postings at the same level. The impact of the earlier message on later messages is what DeLoach and Greenlaw referred to a spillover. Greenlaw and DeLoach (2003) collected data from 10 asynchronous discussions that took place in economics undergraduate classes in the semesters from spring 1998 to spring 2000. The typical discussion lasted for nearly 16 days, and required students to reach consensus about an ‘interpretative’ question within that time period.

Although trust has been identiied as key for virtual teams to work effectively, researchers have not developed scalable methods that consistently promote trust. This study examines the formation of trust perceptions, which is inherently a learning process. Strategies employed to promote more traditional deinitions of learning can be used to promote trust development. In this paper, the authors investigate how a strategy of modifying the design of the communication system for virtual teams can be used to promote perceptions related to trust. The authors conduct an experiment to examine the impact of a template-driven messaging system to scaffold the development of the three antecedents of trust—integrity, benevolence, and ability—within a virtual team environment and communication activity. The study shows that participants who used the template-driven messaging system perceived their team members as having a higher level of ability than those who used the regular system. Moreover, users of the template-driven environment authored more messages and read a greater percentage of the messages, suggesting that messaging scaffolds were successful in improving the low of information and fostering an environment favorable to trust development.",

The  entire  study  lasted  five  weeks:  an initial pre-test was followed by three weeks of participant  interaction,  and  a  post-test. After the initial face-to-face introduction of the ex- periment, all additional directions and informa- tion were handled through e-mail. After receiv- ing the problem description and a list of their team  members,  participants  were  asked  to complete a pre-test questionnaire of the instru- ments, in order to account for the possibility that they might have known their teammates by name and have formed opinions about them outside the context of this experiment. In ad- dition, the pre-test questionnaire measured the presence of any imported trust. The data were collected to examine main treatment  effects  and  included  the  results  of questionnaires  administered  before  and  after the experimental use of the discussion board. The SPSS statistical package (Norusis, 2004) was used to conduct the analysis. The question- naires were the same as those developed and used by Jarvenpaa et al. (1998). This enabled us to analyze the main effects using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (Girden, 1992), with message organization as an independent vari- able,  three  trust-related  dependent  variables: ability, benevolence, integrity and two activity related  variables.  Message  organization  had two levels, template-driven and non-template- driven. The template-driven treatment incorpo- rated the message templates described above. These templates were designed to encourage users to communicate in ways that support trust formation in virtual teams. The antecedents of trust (ability, benevo- lence and integrity) (Mayer et al., 1995), were measured using the scales in Table 2, developed, tested and adapted for use in virtual team settings by Jarvenpaa et al. (1998), based on the work of Schoorman et al. (1996), Mayer et al. (1995), and Meyerson, Weick, and Kramer (1996). This facilitated the testing of our hypotheses H1 – H3 using instruments that have been validated and used in previous studies conducted under conditions similar to this study. All questions were measured on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (to no extent) to 5 (to a great extent). The scales were used to establish pretreatment values  and  ensure  homogeneity  between  the treatment and control groups on the variables prior to the treatment. Establishing this initial value  was  especially  important  because  the context of the project allowed for participants to have had interactions prior to the experiment. Table 1.

Resta and LaFerriere drew one further distinction concerning the general perspective of how these types of learning are viewed. Cooperative learning is based on how interaction is structured while collaborative learning is more of a philosophy.  Practically speaking, Joung and Keller theorized three differences between highly structured cooperative learning (HSCP) groups and low structured collaborative learning (LSCL) groups.  They believed HSCP groups might have a tendency to make better decisions, achieve a greater improvement in critical thinking, and be more interactive than their LSCL counterparts. More generally, the literature shows a number of benefits – both realized and potential – produced from CSCL environments.  Kreijns et al. (2002) recognized two of the more obvious advantages.  CSCL environments have an anywhere-anytime characteristic allowing its members to be geographically dispersed and the added practical benefit of cost efficiencies due to the need for fewer instructors and their reduction in the instructional process.  In addition, they also heralded its ability to generate group learning.  Joung and Keller (2004) acknowledged five CSCL benefits – academic achievement, greater higher order thinking skills, increased levels of student satisfaction, better individual and group products, and better group cognition – but stressed that the research in these areas was still “shallow”.

To observe critical thinking skills in wiki collaborations under dif- ferent levels of instructional guidance, two graduate wikibook projects were selected: an enhanced scaffolding case (ESC) which involved structured wikibook guidelines and critical feedback exercises, and a minimal scaffolding case (MSC) which involved only basic wikibook guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods were adopted to compare students’ perceived and observed levels of critical thinking and participation in wikibook creation. Results showed that participants in the ESC dis- played relatively higher critical thinking levels as wikibook authors and peer editors. Participants in the MSC displayed relatively lower critical thinking levels, but showed more active participation in terms of the frequencies of words edited in wikibook chapters. As peer editors, however, students in both cases tended to show low levels of critical thinking and participate passively even though they considered wikibooks to be a useful online collaboration tool. Document and interview analyses revealed that MSC students experienced difﬁculties developing their wikibooks due to the lack of instructional assistance and displayed more trial and error, which led to their low critical thinking levels and high participation levels.

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT A qualitative analysis of eighteen college students using different types of scaffolding (instructional supports) while working on a World Wide Web (WWW) project was conducted. Four different support mechanisms were examined: a) WWW resources; b) procedural guidelines for the instructional c) student-student interactions; and d) instructor-student interac- activity; tions. Three major findings related to use of the WWW as a resource-based learning environment are discussed: a) the utility of scaffolds and WWW resources seem dependent on the ability of learners to readily grasp how the scaffold or resource could help them; b) learners’ preconceptions and search strategies were difficult to alter, despite ongoing evidence that searching was not leading to project clarification; and c) social scaffolding based on face to face dialogue with instructors and peers was critical to helping learners manage the complexity of the open- ended project. Implications related to the role of instructional scaffolding in encouraging shared meaning and learning with WWW resources are considered.",

The participants chose their own project topics and elected whether to work in self-selected groups or by them- selves. Participant descriptions, project topics, and ratings of WWW knowledge and topic knowledge are provided in Table 1. The knowledge of the WWW ratings were derived from a technology survey given at the beginning of the semester and from researcher observations during and following data collection. The topic knowl- edge rating came from researcher observations during and following data collection. Emphasis was placed on these two types of knowledge since they are significant to learning with open-ended environments (such as resource-based WWW environ- ments) where hypermedia resources are required [34]. As can be seen from Table 1, eight cases were formed from students choosing to work in six different groups of two or three, and two students choosing to work independently. The first four cases (N = 9) shown in Table 1 were selected for in- depth analysis based on the following criteria: 1) richness of information and completeness of videotapes and think-aloud protocols in relation to the research questions; 2) diversity of project ideas; and 3) diversity of grouping options (two groups of three; one group of two; and one individual). For three of the four remain- ing cases we had technical problems that resulted in limited audio data on the first day. Aditionally, three cases chose trip planning as their topic and we decided to",

        "abstract": " Abstract This study explores young children’s ability to construct and explain adaptive behaviors of a behaving artifact, an autonomous mobile robot with sensors. A central component of the behavior construction environment is the RoboGan software that sup- ports children’s construction of spatiotemporal events with an a-temporal rule structure. Six kindergarten children participated in the study, three girls and three boys. Activities and interviews were conducted individually along ﬁve sessions that included increasingly complex construction tasks. It was found that all of the children succeeded in constructing most such behaviors, debugging their constructions in a relatively small number of cycles. An adult’s assistance in noticing relevant features of the problem was necessary for the more complex tasks that involved four complementary rules. The spatial scaffolding afforded by the RoboGan interface was well used by the children, as they consistently used partial backtracking strategies to improve their constructions, and employed modular construction strategies in the more complex tasks. The children’s explanations following their construction usually capped at one rule, or two condition-action couples, one rule short of their ﬁnal constructions. With respect to tasks that involved describing a dem- onstrated robot’s behavior, in describing their constructions, explanations tended to be more rule-based, complex and mechanistic. These results are discussed with respect to the importance of making such physical/computational environments available to young children, and support of young children’s learning about such intelligent systems and reasoning in developmentally-advanced forms.",

The study examines learners’ subjective responses to the use of the World Wide Web within the context of a research project on American states. Data was collected using observations and sur- veys including demographic information and student perceptions via subjective-quantitative and qualitative questionnaire items. Analyses con- sisted of descriptive statistics on the quantitative items and a multi-stage synthesis of the qualitative data including categorical and thematic analysis. With respect to categorical analysis, the excerpts of students’ responses were categorized using two codes based on whether they related more to the chal- lenges or advantages of using the Web and then under each category they were further subdivided, resulting in twenty subcategories in total. A number of themes were drawn from this data. Learners found the experience gener- ally positive. Negative responses were found to relate to technical problems and information overload. The project stimulated incidental learning. However, information seeking on the Net simultaneously engendered both anxiety and excitement in learners. From this study, it could be concluded that com- puter-learning networks have the potential to empower students in well-designed language learning environments. The Web-based language project provided an opportunity to enhance students’ reading and writing proficiency and to harness their skills in information searching and prob- lem-solving to varying degrees. However, some frustration with the challenges and difficulties in relation to computers and language were found. A computer-mediated learning experience in Language Studies could not be achieved by itself simply by the introduction of the learner to the Web tech- nology. Providing scaffolding, both in using Internet applications and in orienting the learners to the task, is vital to the successful implementation",

Annotation means a kind of additional information to emphasize the explanations for the learning  objects.  The  use  of  annotations  is  to  support  the  cognitive  process  for  PowerPoint  presentation  in  a classroom. The construction of the learning environment is based on cognitive theory of multimedia learning so as  to  figure  out  the  impact  of  using  annotation  in  classroom  learning.  PowerPoint  materials  and  their corresponding multimedia annotations can be simultaneously displayed in the environment. While teaching the current  PowerPoint  slide,  it  is  displayed  through  one  channel  (or  projector)  and  the  related  annotation  or  its previous slide is exhibited through the other channel (or the other projector). This manner can scaffold learners’ coherent  mental  representations  so  as  to  enhance  their  learning  performance.  In  this  study,  an  exploratory method was conducted with 170 sophomore and junior students ranging in age between 18 and 21 years. Survey results  indicated  that  the  proposed  system  based  on  cognitive  theory  can  effectively  help  students  in  the experimental  group  to  have  better  learning  efficacy  for  lectures  with  dual-slide  PowerPoint  presentation  than that of the conventional group.",

A total of 155 Taiwanese eighth graders participated in this study. Regarding computer achievement, a significant interaction was found between gender and learning context. No significant difference was found in students’ computer attitudes due to either learning context or gender factor. With respect to computer anxiety, however, the boys exhibited a significantly higher level than did the girls. Students’ computer anxiety in the cooperative learning group was also significantly higher than that in the control group. It is believed that the culture of socialization involving com- puters plays an important role in junior high school computer classrooms. In addition, strategic learning is regarded as an effective approach to promote female students’ learning with computers.",

HARRY, a web-based computer tutor, provides a Vygotskian-like scaffolding of the knowledge transforming mature writing process and presents it to children individually in a conference situation. The effects of the computer tutor are analysed by comparing stories produced by three children of varied writing ability, who wrote a control and a HARRY-assisted story, and by observing the children as they wrote. A control group also wrote two stories without receiving assistance for either story. The study’s hypothesis was conﬁrmed. With HARRY’s assistance, the children wrote better stories and employed the revision process characteristic of learn to adopt the mature mature writers. Vygotsky’s work suggests that children will approach from repeated use of the system and that the scaffolding should be reduced gradually. However, as the system relied upon the children’s willingness to ﬁrst request, then act upon the available guidance, the system would beneﬁt from further development to ensure children interact sufﬁciently with HARRY. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The multimedia interface actively engages learn- techniques include project-based and problem-based ers. learning, “just-in-time” remediation, scaffolding, mentoring, and indivi- dualized instruction. The assessment is transparent in that it is embedded in computer-assisted tasks. This ensures consistent monitoring of learner progress and skill mastery without interrupting the learner. This study eval- uates the training performance of 206 learners (86% completion rate), and tracks learners’ employment or continuing education rate during a 90-day follow-up period. Results indicate that 67% of learners gained employment or continued their education, and 15% received raises or changed jobs for higher salaries. The average wage increase was $1.06 per hour. The success of the ILE validates the application of multimedia-based simulation to education.",

Twenty-eight classes were offered at a variety of sites, including community-based organizations, high schools, technical colleges, and community colleges. Each site offering the EnterTech class was responsible for recruiting the learners. A total of 238 learners started EnterTech training, 206 (86%) completed the training. Table 1 reports demographic information for both the completers and non-completers. Demographic information was collected through an online survey. Survey data was missing for 28 completers and 17 non- completers due to instructors failing to inform learners about the online survey. For the learners completing EnterTech, the mean age was 27.5 years with a standard deviation of 11.8, minimum age of 16.1, and maximum age of 65 years. For the non-completers, the mean age was 31.3 years with a standard deviation of 10.2, minimum age of 19, and maximum age of 48.5 years. During telephone calls with non-completers, most of the learners attributed language barriers and lack of computer skills as their reasons for ending training. EnterTech is a modular program allowing for flexibility in deployment of the 45 hours of training. As a result, EnterTech classes were administered for varying lengths of time.

Participants were 48 undergraduates who wrote on-line discussion notes in response to two issues in educational psychology.

There was a significant positive main effect of note starters on the frequency of disagreement, as well as personality-treatment interactions between note starters and several personality characteristics, The results suggest that note starters are most useful for students with low degrees of curiosity (“openness to ideas”) or assertiveness, and who are not overly anxious.

In general, psychological studies o f medical expertise based on similar approaches encountered more failures than successes, and never reproduced results consistent with other studies demonstrating the effect o f expertise on memory (Norman, Brooks, & Smith,  1994).  Explanations to account for these failures include errors in research methodology (Patel, Groen, & Frederikson,  1986),  and the finding o f the intermediate effect (Rikers,  Schmidt,  & Boshuizen, 2000). The intermediate effect refers to the finding that intermediate subjects perform better on memory tasks than either experts or novices (Schmidt & Boshuizen,  1993). When performance is further scrutinized, it was found that, with unlimited time, intermediates included: unnecessary elaborations explaining patient problems,  extraneous information from a patient, over-elaborate findings,  and, generate more diagnostic hypotheses o f poor quality then novices or experts (Schmidt, Norman, & Boshuizen,  1990).  In medicine, acquisition o f expertise is characterized by a development pattern in which periods o f learning are followed by periods of consolidation o f knowledge. This results in temporary decrements o f performance (Patel, Glaser,  & Arocha, 2000). Patel, Kaufman,  and Arocha (2002) suggested that while intermediates have acquired an extensive body o f biomedical knowledge, it has yet to be reorganized and processed in a manner to be readily available for solving problems.

Compar- isons can then be made with data collected by the students. After the presentation of the topics in the lessons, stu- dents go on to practice these concepts with more inde- pendence in a guided case study environment. The case study is about a young girl called Sarah, who may be re- moved from her after-school program because of her ag- gressive behavior. Students observe Sarah in two settings to determine whether she is indeed more aggressive than her age-matched peers. Figure 1 shows the opening screen of the case study. Here, students once again encounter their virtual consultant Dr. Wellington and can hear from the teachers and parents. In the case study, students work in teams to develop an operational definition for aggressive behavior. They design a coding sheet, determine interrater reliability, and interpret and write up their results. They are guided in this process by Dr. Wellington’s advice. She provides reviews of concepts through interactive quizzes that require the students to enter their decisions into the program before advancing in the program. The students using the case study are in a type of apprenticeship situa- tion (Gardner, 1991) in which they have the model and the support of both a real and a virtual instructor, but they are also expected to make most decisions for themselves. All the students’ work is saved in an XML (extensible markup language) file, and when the students exit and reenter the program, they can pick up where they left off. For exam- ple, Figure 2 shows the point in the case study at which Dr. Wellington prompts students to design their observation and develop an appropriate coding sheet. Students decide how many children to observe and the length of the ap- propriate interval and enter it into the program.1 The pro-",

        "abstract": " Abstract: In the last decade, impairments in several cognitive domains have been recognized as a central feature of schizophrenia. Consistent evidence has accumulated that documents the contribution of these deficits to poor out- come in social and occupational functioning, and thus they are important targets for psychosocial as well as pharma- cological intervention. After reviewing the literature on cognitive remediation for brain injury as well as schizophrenia patients, consulting with research groups which have implemented cognitive remediation programs for schizophrenia, and conducting pilot work with patients, our group has developed a broadly-targeted computer-based remediation intervention that is based on using exercises that engage several cognitive capacities simultaneously, teaching of a set of cognitive strategies by a supportive therapist in a one-on-one setting, and addressing many of the treatment issues that are specific to schizophrenia. The strategies that are emphasized in the intervention are derived from the learning and remediation literatures and include the following: 1) Verbalization to enhance encoding and re- call of stimuli; 2) Breaking problems down to promote organized problem solving; 3) Articulation of problem solving to encourage deliberate responding and self-monitoring; 4) Self-checking of performance and adjustment as necessary; 5) Strategic probe questions to prompt participants to monitor their work and make planful responses; 6) Scaffolding aids to provide ongoing support as needed. We are currently conducting a randomized trial of the intervention in which patients complete 24 sessions of remediation or an equivalent number of sessions with a therapist using computer games that have minimal cognitive demand. Our initial experience with the intervention is encouraging and suggests that it is feasible, the tasks are extremely well-received and patients are willing to come to the clinic several times per week to work on them. It is premature to assess whether participation in cognitive remediation is effective in improv- ing cognition, but patients have thus far demonstrated improvement on trained computer exercises. The potential of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, alone and in combination, for cognitive impairment in schizophre- nia is a promising research issue.",

The study explored the perceptions and attitudes as well as the interactive processes, behavior and patterns of K3 children learning information technology via a cooperative approach. Data collection included a survey, the instructors(cid:1) observations and reﬂective journals as well as interviews with the students. The ﬁndings of the study are summarized in the following four areas. First, generally speaking, the study showed the positive value of a cooperative approach when eﬀectively integrated into computer curriculums. Second, the study found that group interaction was more procedure- related, including topic choice, duty assignation, content selection, and computer operation. Third, it was found that most learners mastered computer skills, but approached their knowledge-building project with less of a sense of synthesis and integration. Finally, the study found four diﬀerent forms of interactions (Individual, Authoritative, Argumentative and Consolidated) emerging during the earlier stages of learning with group cohesion increasing at later stages. It can be concluded that learners(cid:1) attitudes and interactive quality in their group learning is promoted to varying degrees, and most learners are capable of mastering computer skills. However, given the time limitation of four months and that it was the instructors(cid:1) and learners(cid:1) ﬁrst attempt at cooperative learning, there was still much to learn for mastery of the course and much to be desired in scaﬀolding learners(cid:1) for highly eﬀective cooperative learning.

Using a naturalistic approach, we collected multiple sources of data during an 8-month instructional unit that emphasized water quality and relevant concepts. The analyses show that constructing and interpreting graphs and tables provided students with opportunities to discuss, review, and clarify questions about concepts and the inquiry process. At the end of the unit on water quality, students were capable of fully participating in designing a more complicated inscription and interpreting new inscriptions. The ﬁndings suggest that four features of the learning environment promoted the development of inscriptional practices: (1) embedding the use of inscriptions in students’ science inquiry; (2) providing scaffolds to support students’ inquiry process; (3) sequencing tasks and the inquiry process; and (4) engaging students in science inquiry in an iterated manner. This study provides insight into the design of a learning environment in which students can develop competent scientiﬁc practices. (cid:1) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 43: 63–95, 2006 Scientiﬁc inscriptions constitute an integral part of science practices (Lemke, 1998). Graphs, diagrams, data tables, symbols, maps, and models are widely seen in science textbooks and professional articles. These inscriptions are types of transformations that materialize or visualize an entity into another format or mode (Latour, 1987). They convey information, organize data, demonstrate patterns and relationships, and communicate scientiﬁc knowledge. Science studies suggest that scientiﬁc knowledge and the reality of science are constructed through manipulating a variety of inscriptions (Knorr-Cetina, 1983; Lynch & Woolgar, 1990). Scientiﬁc inscriptions not only display the information in a different mode, but also multiply and re-create meanings of the given information that otherwise cannot be realized (Lemke, 1998).",

Before the collaboration, the novice class tended to produce isolated notes filled with information and confined their efforts to their own selected topics. When the more experienced class joined in, the discourse of the students in the novice class changed from more information-centered toward meaning negotiations; many more of their notes were linked with one another and they no longer confined their reading and responses to their own study topic. The class more experienced in knowledge building was more ready to express disagreement in their discourse. There was also evidence that the novice class learned from the experienced class to ask more questions in their online discussion. When the joint-collaboration ended, the novice class could still maintain the changed interaction patterns that reflected a stronger knowledge building orientation.",

These students had used KF as a learning environment fully integrated into their school learning experience since first grade. In fact, teachers in this school adopted not only the technology platform, but also the knowledge building approach in their pedagogical practices. The Canadian teacher in this study had been teaching the participating class for more than three years before the collaboration with the Hong Kong students took place. During his previous teaching experience with this class, he had tried exploring different grouping strategies in KF activities (see Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, & Messina, 2005). In the first year, he adopted a “specialized groups model” so that students were divided into six groups to work on topics according to their identified interest. In the second year, he adopted an “interacting groups model” so that although students still formed six groups, they were encouraged to work on topics of other groups. In the third year, the specialized student groups were abandoned and a more flexible “opportunistic collaboration model” was adopted, in which students began with a shared top-level goal, and then identified different sub-goals to continue their work. KF provided a public space for them to freely work on topics they were interested in and to derive new related topics or sub-topics to work on, without the need for any prior assignment. Through this process of exploration, the Canadian teacher had actually facilitated his students to move from a task orientation to learning (i.e. focusing only on delivering learning outcomes related to the specialized topic they identified), towards an idea improvement and learning for understanding orientation. While the Canadian students were experienced in knowledge building and the use of the technology platform KF, the 22 Hong Kong students were totally new to this online environment. Although they were familiar with face-to-face discussions in class, they have never engaged in CSCL activities nor have they encountered the 130 / LAI AND LAW knowledge building approach which emphasizes the continual improvement of ideas through intentional interactions with one another.",

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies can connect novice teachers in ways that are both time and place independent. Most research on asynchronous online discussions has focused on achieving formal learning goals through highly structured scaffolds for reflective thinking and cognitive presence. Less attention is being paid to how novice teachers who are already accustomed to participating in online communities turn to these online spaces for the support they need. This case study examined whether and how eight preservice teachers completing English education internships at professional development schools chose to use an asynchronous discussion forum in the absence of a tightly structured or controlled communication task. The interns chose to use the online space for just-in-time informal learning and for psychological support on complex issues that were not easy to discuss face to face. The interns regularly responded to each others’ requests, thoughts, and concerns. The authors propose that highly structured online forums are not the only way CMC can be used for teacher support, particularly now that CMC is no longer a novelty, nor should formal learning be the only purpose for providing such online spaces to novice teachers.",

However, when using avatars, it is not easy for children to practise and reﬁne their speaking skills by narrating their stories to an audience. The program- ming difﬁculties involved in that process tend to distract attention away from the col- laborative storytelling activity itself. This study therefore proposes an interaction model featuring tangible story avatars (TSAs) that can serve as a platform to scaffold collabo- rative story creation, revision and narrative. A 9-week study with 16 children aged 8 years was conducted to evaluate the interaction model with the TSAs. The results suggest that the TSAs may play three primary roles in facilitating collaborative storytell- ing: as a tool for developing conﬁdence, as a tool for reﬂective story development and as a group artefact. Researchers and educators may ﬁnd it valuable to consider these three roles in designing the TSAs in support of collaborative storytelling in similar contexts.",

The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of group interaction and determine how to best support the collaborative learning process. To that end, we propose a principled framework for the study and analysis of group interaction and group scaffolding which is built by combining different aspects and issues of collaboration, learning and evaluation. In particular, we deﬁne learning activity indicators at several levels of description which prompt to the application of a mixed interaction analysis scheme and the use of different data types and speciﬁc tools. At an initial layer, the basis of the approach is set by applying a qualitative process for evaluating the individual and group task performance as well as the group functioning and scaffolding. The interaction analysis process is completed by deﬁning and applying two more layers: a social network analysis of the group activity and participation behaviour and a quantitative analysis of group effectiveness as regards task achievement and active interaction involvement. Our work deﬁnes a grounded and holistic conceptual model that describes on-line collaborative learning interactions sufﬁciently and applies it in a real, web-based, complex and long-term collaborative learning situation. An in-depth empirical evaluation of the conceptual model is fully discussed, which demonstrates the usefulness and value of the approach. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We suggest that in computer contexts extended conceptualisations of scaVolding are needed in order to gain greater insights into teaching and learning processes. Our work has revealed that traditional forms of scaVolding, based on the “expert’s” view of how the problem should be solved, need to be modiWed in order to accommodate the child’s perspective and that three diVerent types of scaVolding which we refer to as cognitive, technical and aVective can be conceptualized. This paper discusses the ways in which the per- formance of pairs of children is enhanced in such scaVolding contexts, to include more examples of meta- strategic processes and strategies for problem-solving, than when the pairs are left to spontaneously solve the problems. This study provides additional support that cognitive, aVective and technical scaVolding are beneWcial for learning and that children are able to support each others learning via sharing strategies and articulating the reasons behind them to each other.",

To help students gain content knowledge as well as writing and reviewing skills, SWoRD supports the whole cycle of writing, reviews, back-reviews, and rewriting by scaﬀolding the journal publication process as its authentic practice model. In addition, SWoRD includes algorithms that compute individual reviewer(cid:2)s review accuracy, which is in turn used to support the various drawbacks of reciprocal peer reviews (e.g., variation in motivation or ability of reviewers). Finally, this paper describes an empirical evaluation showing that the SWoRD approach is eﬀective in improving writ- ing quality in content classes. (cid:2) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

While an increasing number of educational technology systems support productive metacognitive behavior within the scope of the system, few attempt to teach skills students need to become better future learners. To that end, we offer a set of empirically-based design principles for metacognitive tutoring. Our starting point is a set of design principles put forward by Anderson et al. (Journal of the Learning Sciences, 4:167–207, 1995) regarding Cognitive Tutors, a family of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. We evaluate the relevance of these principles to the tutoring of help-seeking skills, based on our ongoing empirical work with the Help Tutor. This auxiliary tutor agent is designed to help students learn to make effective use of the help facilities offered by a Cognitive Tutor. While most of Anderson’s principles are relevant to the tutoring of help seeking, a number of differences emerge as a result of the nature of metacognitive knowledge and of the need to combine metacognitive and domain-level tutoring. We compare our approach to other metacognitive tutoring systems, and, where appropriate, propose new guidelines to promote the discussion regarding the nature and design of metacognitive tutoring within scaffolded problem- solving environments.",

Although the literature has recommended specific practices for the AD instructor-moderator, little comparative empirical experimental research has been done on this topic. This quasi-experimental, mixed methodology study employed content analysis and focus group techniques to examine the influence of selected instructional tactics (situated and abstract) and moderation styles (social and instrumental) on participant interaction and exchange in four parallel experimental ADs in an undergraduate professional nursing course. The literature suggested that a combination of situated instruction and social moderation would produce more complex AD.  The findings of the present research, however, reveal that the experimental AD group treated with abstract instruction and instrumental moderation posted more messages than the other groups, although the AD group treated with the treatment consisting of a combination of situated instruction and social moderation posted messages that contained higher quantities of higher-order interaction types (such as horizontal questions and personal reflections) than those of the other groups. The study also found that moderation style accounted for greater differences in measures of interaction between the groups than did the instructional tactic, and that social moderation was associated with the posting of more personal reflections and abstract instruction with the posting of more scaffolding statements. The findings of this research suggest that a more comprehensive definition of communicative complexity is needed to identify and quantify higher-order AD interaction.

The student outcomes, student behaviors, and instruction over four units of instruction are described and analyzed, with attention to those behaviors and outcomes emerging from the two units incorporating students’ use of technology. No consistent differences were observed on the teacher-designed end-of-unit assessments, but consistent differences favoring the movie-making condition emerged on the semester exam. These differences were statistically and practically significant for the first intervention, and approached statistical significance for the second. A similar pattern of differences emerged in student and teacher actions during the related end-of-unit projects. Students who created movies used more teacher-selected resources, made fewer factual errors, and addressed more material covered on the semester exam. In the movie-making sections, the teacher provided both synchronous (in-class) and asynchronous (out-of-class, reflective) feedback and guided students through a process of iterative refinement as they developed their products. These differences in student and teacher behaviors by condition were strongest during the first intervention and weaker during the second. During the second intervention, student and teacher use of the movie-making application was reduced due to a disruption in internet access; the use of the application between the first and second interventions was therefore not equivalent.

We pro- vided pre-service primary school teachers with a module on computer modeling and studied the eﬀects of this experience on their abilities to construct viable scientiﬁc models with a computer-mod- eling tool, namely, Model-It [Metcalf, J. S., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (2000). MODEL-IT: A Design Retrospective. In M. J. Jacobson & R. B. Kozma (Eds.), Innovations in Science and Mathe- matics Education (pp. 77–115). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates], in order to teach a sixth-grade science lesson. The results of the study showed that Model-It, through its scaﬀolds (i.e., Plan, Build, and Test), enabled the majority of pre-service teachers to build models that were structurally correct, but simplistic. The participants showed a tendency to teach science using more often the explorative modeling method than the expressive method, and only few of them employed both methods in their lessons. In essence, Model-It eﬀectively scaﬀolded pre-service teachers’ ﬁrst modeling experiences and enabled them to quickly build and test their models as well as reﬂect on the viability of their models. However, according to the results, teachers need extensive learning experiences in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the process of scientiﬁc modeling in science.

Students were required to participate in 13 whole-class meetings and in 13 75-min lab sessions (about 15 students in each lab). For the lab sessions, students were working in groups of three. Prior to taking this course, stu- dents completed a basic computing course where they learned how to use several general- purpose software, and an instructional technology course in which they learned how to integrate educational software in the content domains. None of the participants had any previous experience with Model-It, the software that was used in this study. Two par- ticipants stated that they had limited experience with a diﬀerent computer-modeling tool, but none of them had any prior experience with teaching science through models, or attended any course where the learning process focused on models or the modeling process and their relation to mental models. 2.2. The computer-modeling tool Model-It, a computer-modeling tool, was used in the study. Model-It is a learner-cen- tered tool for building and testing dynamic, qualitative models (Jackson, Stratford, Kra- jcik, & Soloway, 1994; Metcalf et al., 2000; Stratford, Krajcik, & Soloway, 1998). When using Model-It, the user ﬁrst creates objects that correspond to the observable entities of a system, such as sun, soil, plant, air, and so on. As shown in Fig. 1, the system allows the user to associate an icon with each object, so that it is visually associated with what it actually represents. Then, the user associates variable quantities with each object that are called factors. Factors deﬁne measurable or calculable characteristics of an object, such as, for example as shown in Fig. 2, light, water, growth, carbon dioxide, etc.",

Through gathering peer learning inter- actions on 57 college computer science students, who were randomly assigned into 14 small groups for solving programming problems, this study analyzed the content of their discourse interactions. First, it was revealed that the most frequent inter- actions were related to some questions or suggestions regarding how to eﬀectively coordinate peer members. However, dif- ferent features of peer interactions were found across diﬀerent small groups. By time sequence analysis of peer interactions, it was found that issues and positions were proposed mostly in the initial and middle stages of the study, while the conﬂicts frequently occurred in the beginning stage. Finally, this study suggested ﬁve peer interaction patterns in terms of peer knowl- edge exchange, including centralized knowledge exchange, distributive knowledge exchange, group development impedi- ment, ability impediment and partial knowledge exchange. A further analysis of students’ knowledge exchange patterns revealed that peer students’ background abilities played an important role on the ways of knowledge exchange involved in the on-line peer learning activity. Certain conﬁgurations of students’ background abilities tended to lead to a particular communication pattern. The implications derived from the ﬁndings for educational practice were also discussed. For exam- ple, the small groups with peer members of high achievement (or heterogeneous abilities) may not guarantee the success of group work. Many of them need teachers or moderators to scaﬀold the process of peer interactions and learning. (cid:2) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Participants The knowledge area Learning Strategies (http://knowcat.ii.uam.es/estrategiasAprendizaje/) was created by the 31 students enrolled in the course ‘‘Learning Strategies’’, at the UdL. The students used the system during 10 weeks. 3.3. Procedure: main characteristics of the instructional context This knowledge area started with a knowledge tree composed of ﬁve topics (see Fig. 1) related to the course contents. The students selected individually one topic of the tree that they wanted to do more work on. For each topic, the students had to accomplish the following instructional tasks: (a) Each student had to search in the net a document relevant to the selected topic and add it to the system. This document could be a Web document by another author. Then the students voted for the document which, in their opinion, best described the topic. At the end of the ﬁrst task, we obtained a crystallised document (i.e. the best description of the topic according to the users’ opinions) for each topic and the non-crystallised documents were removed from the system. (b) Students contributed with their own document to the selected topic. This document contained a personal report about the crystallised document from the ﬁrst task. The report consisted of three main parts: (i) synthesis of the main ideas of the crystallised document; (ii) relations with the contents of the course ‘‘Learning Strategies’’; and (iii) personal reﬂection about the main ideas of the crystallised documents and their educational application. (c) Students read one or several peer’s reports and wrote, at least, three notes to other classmates’ reports. Students agreed that the objective of these notes would be to help classmates to improve his/her report and they were strongly encouraged to annotate the reports of diﬀerent classmates. (d) Students voted for one report as the best description of the topic. (e) The document’s author read classmates’ notes concerning his/her own report and, taking into account their opinions, s/he re-wrote the new document version- and submitted it to the system again. (f) Finally, they gave their opinions about the ‘‘continuity’’ and ‘‘improvement’’ characteristics of the new document versions (see Section 2.2) in order to facilitate the system the decisions over which documents had to be replaced with their new document version.

Towards accomplishing this goal, we generated machine-learned mod- els that can detect when students test their articulated hypotheses, design controlled experiments, and engage in planning behaviors using two inquiry support tools. Mod- els were trained using labels generated through a new method of manually hand-coding log ﬁles, “text replay tagging”. This approach led to detectors that can automatically and accurately identify these inquiry skills under student-level cross-validation. The resulting detectors can be applied at run-time to drive scaffolding intervention. They can also be leveraged to automatically score all practice attempts, rather than hand- classifying them, and build models of latent skill proﬁciency. As part of this work, we also compared two approaches for doing so, Bayesian Knowledge-Tracing and an averaging approach that assumes static inquiry skill level. These approaches were compared on their efﬁcacy at predicting skill before a student engages in an inquiry activity, predicting performance on a paper-style multiple choice test of inquiry, and M. A.

Yet, this divide seems to run less along traditional lines, suggesting that personal factors play a more important role. Motivation and anxiety are two related but distinct personal factors that inﬂu- ence computer use and skills in this population. We also found that these factors are mediated by the family context: motivation is higher when (young) children are present in the family. Moreover, children may represent an important form of social support for women not yet using computers. This study concludes that the concerns about the gender gap in computer use may beneﬁt from taking the scaffolding possibilities of the family into consideration and that there may be a case for growing optimism in the use of information and communication technology for adult learning in speciﬁc, gender-segregated professions with low status.",

A mixed-method analysis of the evolution of participation inequity (PI) in group discussions suggested that participation levels tended to get locked-in relatively early on in the discussion. Similarly, high (low) quality member contributions made earlier in a discussion did more good (harm) than those made later on. Both PI and diﬀerential impact of member contributions suggest a high sensitivity to early exchange; both signiﬁcantly predict- ing the eventual group performance, as measured by solution quality. Consequently, eventual group performance could be predicted based on what happened in the ﬁrst 30–40% of a discussion.

However, its underlying principles and functionality are not well understood, which has resulted in an inconsistency in practice. This study identiﬁes the underlying constructs of WebQuests as perceived by teachers and variables affecting their perceptions on WebQuests. A survey was conducted on teachers (n = 226) recruited from one large research university in the USA and a professional listserv. The ﬁndings reveal three constructs per- ceived by teachers as critical to WebQuests: constructivist problem solving, social interaction and scaffolded learning. Results also show that variables like purpose of WebQuest use, years of teaching, years of WebQuest use and gender predict, at various degrees, teachers’ percep- tions on WebQuests. Discussions are made on how the constructs identiﬁed can be used to improve online teaching and learning. Suggestions for future study are included by examining the inﬂuences of social, psychological and affective factors on learners’ learning in WebQuests.",

Findings showed that the wiki platform provided educational, technological, and social affordances for the P5 students’ collaborative learning. At the same time, constraints were found to be related to technological factors and  users’  dispositions,  which  may  be  counterbalanced  by  providing  scaffolding  and  selecting  wiki  variants. Students’ attitudes towards the pedagogical value of the wiki were found to be strongly positive after the group project  implementation.

All students in the cohort were included in the study. Results from the cohort of 2000 are presented in a separate study, as at that time some groups partici- pated in the interactive examination through tele- conference settings.5 Eight persons were involved as assessors in the interactive examination; these com- prised 6 clinical instructors (4 female, 2 male) and 2 assessors (2 male – mentioned as (cid:1)main assessor(cid:2) and (cid:1)secondary assessor(cid:2)). The clinical instructors held regular meetings, where they revised the learning objectives for the third semester and the quality assessment criteria for clinical work. The 2 assessors rated student performance in the written part of the examination and evaluated the students’ comparison documents and prepared the individualised feedback.

While studying the worked-out exam- ples as well as in a later problem-solving phase, the participants were re- quired to think aloud. The learners were divided into two groups according to their performance in a problem-solving phase: successful and unsuccessful learners. A comparison between these two groups revealed that the success- ful problem solvers assigned more time to the study of the worked-out exam- ples than the unsuccessful ones. Accordingly, they produced more task-rele- vant ideas while trying to explain the example solutions to themselves. In addition, there were also qualitative differences between the good and the poor problem solvers. The successful learners (a) more frequently elabo- rated on the application conditions and goals of operators, (b) more fre- quently related solution steps to the domain principles presented in the text (principle-based explanations), and (c) more adequately monitored their comprehension. That is, good learners more frequently diagnosed compre- hension failures and less frequently had the illusion of comprehension (for similar results see Ferguson-Hessler & deJong, 1990; Pirolli & Recker, 1994). Interestingly, a re-analysis of Chi et al.’s data by Chi and VanLehn (1991) showed that there were no differences between the good and poor learners with respect to prior domain knowledge and ability (i.e., GPA). A restriction of the Chi et al. (1989) study was that the quantity (time- on-task) and quality of the learning processes were confounded. Thus, it could not be deﬁnitely ruled out that the effective learners were superior merely because they devoted more time to the elaboration of the worked- out examples. In an extension of the work of Chi et al., Renkl (1997) showed that even when keeping time-on-task constant, qualitative differences in self- explanations were related to learning outcomes (learning domain: probability calculation). In particular, the successful learners in that study tended to ex- plicate goal-operator combinations more frequently, employ more principle- based explanations and more anticipative reasoning (i.e., anticipation of solu- tion steps in the presently studied examples). In addition, it was shown that only a minority of students could be classiﬁed as good self-explainers. Renkl (1997), like Chi and VanLehn (1991), also found that prior domain knowledge in mathematics was not related to self-explanation characteristics. In contrast, prior topic knowledge (cf. Alexander, Kulikowich, & Schulze, 1994) in probability calculation showed some evidence of being positively related to at least one type of self-explanation activity, namely anticipative reasoning (Renkl, 1997). The aforementioned studies on self-explanation were correlational in na- ture. Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other variables not",

Building on the information processing theory of self-regulated learning (SRL),of P. Winne and colleagues, the study examined: (1) students' self-regulation; (2) co- regulation; and (3) the role of the teacher as an external regulator during a knowledge construction activity. Sixteen llth and 12th graders were randomly assigned to one of two goal-setting instructional conditions (teacher-set goals (TSG)and learner generated sub-goals (LGSG)). Students used RiverWeb (tm), the simulation, collaboratively during a 3-week curriculum on environmental science. The students' emerging understanding was assessed using their pretest and posttest scores, and was also assessed through an analysis of their discourse during several.collaborative problem-solving episodes. The LGSG condition facilitated a shift in students' mental models significantly more than did the TSG condition. Students in the LGSG condition were also better at regulating and co-regulating their learning ability during the knowledge construction activity. In general, they planned and monitored their learning more efficiently by creating sub-goals, activating prior knowledge, and engaging in adaptive help-seeking. They also used more effective learning strategies and were more effective in handling task difficulties and demands than was the TSG group. Results provide an initial characterization of the complexity of self- and co-regulated learning in a complex, dynamic technology-enhanced student-centered classroom. (Contains 1",

        "participants": " participants in the learning process. Learners construct their own meanings, goals, and strategies from the information available from both the internal (i.e., cognitive system) and the external (i.e., context) environment. A second assumption is based on the idea that learners are capable of monitoring, controlling, and regulating aspects of their own cognition, motivation, behavior, and context (e.g., the learning environment). Third, biological, developmental, contextual, and individual constraints can impede or interfere with a learner's ability to monitor or control his or her cognition, motivation, behavior, or context. Fourth, all models assume that there is a goal, criterion, or standard against which the learner makes comparisons in order to assess whether the process should continue or if some type of change (e.g., in strategies) is necessary. In a learning situation, a learner sets goals or standards to strive for in his or her learning, monitors progress toward these goals, and then adapts and regulates cognition, motivation, behavior, and context to reach the goals. Fifth, self-regulatory activities are mediators between personal and contextual characteristics and actual achievement or performance. In other words, it is not just the learner's cultural, demographic, or personality features that influence achievement and learning directly, or only contextual characteristics of the classroom that shape achievement, but it is the learner's self-regulation of his or her cognition, motivation, and behavior that mediates these relationships. In addition to these critical defining features, models of self-regulated learning typically propose four phases of self-regulated learning (Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2000). The first phase includes planning and goal setting (Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2001), activation of perceptions and knowledge of the task (Winne 2001; Winne & Hadwin, 1998), and the self in relationship to the task (Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2001). The second phase includes various monitoring processes that represent metacognitive awareness of different aspects of the self, task and context (Schunk, 2001). Phase three involves the student's efforts to control and regulate different aspects of the self, task, and context. Lastly, phase four represents various kinds of reactions and reflections on the self and the task and/or context (Winne, 2001; Winne & Hadwin,",

The RNP curriculum appeared to her to be better equipped to do that. Conversations with her led to this study. Her district would pilot the RNP curriculum within a structured study to evaluate whether this curriculum was better suited to the district's goals for fractions than either of the two commercial series used within the district. An examination of the RNP curriculum and commercial curricula by project staff suggested that the former had a better alignment with the Standards' fraction goals than the latter. This study would determine whether that was in fact the case as well as identify differences between learners using these two different approaches. Although both the commercial and RNP curricula covered the same topics, the emphasis on the topics varied. Our examination of the curricula showed that students using the CC would devote less time than RNP students to developing an understanding of the meaning of fractions at the concrete level and more time to developing operational skill and procedures for ordering fractions and finding fraction equivalence.

These eﬀects were studied using a sample of 1274 students from economically disadvantaged schools in Chile. The videogames were speciﬁcally designed to address the educational goals of the ﬁrst and second years of school, for basic mathematics and reading comprehension. The sample was divided into experimental groups (EG), internal control groups (IC) and external control groups (EC). Students in the EG groups, used the experimental video games during an average of 30 h over a 3-month period. They were evaluated on their acquisition of reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematical skills, and on their motivation to use video games. Teachers’ expectations of change due to the use of video games, their technological transfer, and handling of classroom dynamics, were assessed through ad hoc tests and classroom observations. The results show signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the EG and IC groups in relation to the EC group in Math, Reading Comprehension and Spelling, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in these aspects were found between the EG and the IC groups. Teacher reports and classroom observations conﬁrm an improvement in motivation to learn, and a positive technological transfer of the experimental tool. Although further studies regarding the eﬀects of learning through videogame use are imperative, positive eﬀects on motivation and classroom dynamics, indicate that the introduction of educational video games can be a useful tool in promoting learning within the classroom. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These results support our strong belief that teaching descriptive geometry can highly improve the spatial ability of students.

One  aspect  of  human  cognition  that  has  been  frequently studied  using  VR  technology  is  spatial  ability.  Research ranges from training studies that investigate whether and/or how  spatial  ability  can  be  improved  by  using  these  new technologies  to  studies  that  focus  on  specific  aspects  of spatial  ability  for  which  VR  is  an  efficient  investigational tool.  In  this  paper  we  first  review  studies  that  used  VR technologies  to  study  different  aspects  of  spatial  ability. Then results and findings will be presented from one of the first large-scale studies (215 students) that investigated the potential of an AR application to train spatial ability.",

Changes  on  virtual  objects  can  be undone very easily which often is not possible when using real  objects:  \"The  real  power  of  VR  technology  is  that  it allows  people  to  expand  their  perception  of  the  real-world in  ways  that  were  previously  impossible\"  [36,  S. 154].  An additional  advantage  of  using  computer  generated environments  lies  in  the  possibilities  of  automatically logging  certain  variables  of  interest  like  reactive  and  non- reactive user data. Compared to other methods of analyzing user  data  (taking  notes,  video  analysis,  etc.)  this  can  be  a very efficient alternative. Durlach  et  al.  [9]  mention  that  most  studies  only  focus  on quite special aspects of spatial ability and \"...little attention has  been  given  to  the  use  of  VEs  for  training  spatial behavior  in  general,  i.e.,  improving  a  subject's  general spatial abilities and skills.\" (p. 5). It is not completely clear which  aspects  of  spatial  ability  can  actually  be  trained  but Durlach  et  al.  argue  that  with  well  designed  training programs,  basic  spatial  abilities  can  be  improved.  Ideally this  kind  of  research  should  be  interdisciplinary,  as researchers  with  different  backgrounds (psychology, engineering,  computer  sciences,  education)  can  bring  in their specific skills and knowledge. Fitting  und  Glück  [12,  13]  compared  spatial  knowledge gained  after  navigation  through  a  virtual  environment  by people  who  self-rated  their  sense  of  orientation  as  high  or low.  The  VE  was  projected  on  a  big  screen  and  64 participants (32 male and 32 female) navigated using cursor keys. Results showed that participants who rated their sense of  orientation  as  high  could  build  up  significantly  more survey knowledge. They used holistic strategies more often (e. g. trying to imagine a map of the environment), whereas participants  who  rated  their  sense  of  orientation  as  low, more often reported not using any strategies. Females who rated their sense of orientation as high, performed better in way  finding  than  those  who  rated  it  low.  In  men  no  such differences could be observed. Astur  et  al.  [1]  investigated  gender  differences  of  people navigating through  a  virtual  Morris-water-maze,  an experimental  setup  that  is  normally  used  to  test  spatial memory in rodents. The task was to find a hidden platform to get out of the water. Men found the platform faster than women (F(1, 51) = 8.74, p < 0.01), and showed a  tendency to  swim  shorter  distances  but  did  not  swim  faster  than women.  Men  more  often  used  a  direct  strategy  whereas women  more often  used  strategies that  where rated as less spatial (swimming in a circle, zigzag).",

        "abstract": " Abstract This paper investigates the use of conversational agents to scaffold on-line collaborative learning discussions through an approach called Academically Produc- tive Talk (APT). In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning, where agents were used to elevate conceptual depth by leading students through directed lines of reasoning (Kumar & Rosé, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 4(1), 2011), this APT-based approach uses generic prompts that en- courage students to articulate and elaborate their own lines of reasoning, and to challenge and extend the reasoning of their teammates. This paper integrates findings from a series of studies across content domains (biology, chemistry, engineering design), grade levels (high school, undergraduate), and facilitation strategies. APT based strategies are contrasted with simply offering positive feedback when the students themselves employ APT facilitation moves in their interactions with one another, an intervention we term Positive Feedback for APT engagement. The pattern of results demonstrates that APT based support for collaborative learning can signif- icantly increase learning, but that the effect of specific APT facilitation strategies is context specific. It appears the effectiveness of each strategy depends upon factors such as the difficulty of the material (in terms of being new conceptual material versus review) and the skill level of the learner (urban public high school vs. selective private university). In contrast, Feedback for APT engagement does not positively impact learning. In addition to an analysis based on learning gains, an automated conversation analysis technique is presented that effectively predicts which strategies are successfully operating in specific contexts. Implications for design of more agile forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning are discussed.",

Second, achievements reﬂect the percentage of correct versus incorrect answers, while the cognitive dimension of perceived learning reﬂects the learner’s sense that some new knowledge has been acquired and some new understanding has been ach- ieved, even if these subjective knowledge and understanding are in contrast to academic conventions (Caspi & Blau, 2011). A subjective evaluation of learning may be an important measure in the context of game-based learning. Self-assessment of the learning process and quality of knowledge acquisition involves metacognitive monitoring and evaluation, which might affect learner’s behavior by leading them to spend more time playing the game and to recruit more cognitive resources (Efklides, 2008; Serra & Metcalfe, 2009; Veenman, 2011). Additionally, perceived learning may be related to learner satisfaction with the learning environment (Baturay, 2010; Lee & Lee, 2008). Therefore, in the context of game-based learning we cannot rely exclusively either on achievements or on perceived learning measures and need to take into account both evaluations of others and self-judgments. 2. Purpose of the current study The purpose of the study is to examine if adding an external conceptual scaffold, in the form of an online study unit which introduces formal knowledge representations, to a business simulation game might help learners solve formal ﬁnancial-mathematical word problems following the game. Additionally, the study explores how adding such an external scaffold might affect learners’ perceived learning, ﬂow, and enjoyment and if learners’ perceptions regarding learning, ﬂow, and enjoyment in the game are related to their learning achievements. The research questions examined in the study are: 1. How does supplementing a game with an external conceptual scaffold affect learners’ ability to solve formal mathematical-ﬁnancial word problems following the game? 2. How does supplementing a game with an external conceptual scaffold affect learners’ perceptions of learning, ﬂow, and enjoyment in",

Finally, I have already described language as a sign system which Vygotsky considered central to learning abstract concepts.  He felt the use of words as signs “provides for decontextualization” and permits us to make sense of concepts far removed from “concrete context” (Driscoll, 2005, p. 259).  This suggests that to the degree the students in the current study are English language learners, English being the language of instruction, significant achievement barriers would exist.  For this reason, the study was designed to allow students to use Spanish as needed to communicate and develop drafts. The only language restriction was that their final product would need to be in English. Further, in order to tap into their “funds of knowledge” (Gonzalez et al., 1995), students were explicitly requested to be creative and explain chemistry concepts by drawing from their own backgrounds and cultural experiences.",

Participants Participants were 28 seventh graders (14 year-olds), coming from two different classes (Nclass1 ¼ 14 and Nclass2 ¼ 14) of a public school (Gymnasium) in Nicosia, Cyprus. Overall, there were equal numbers of boys and girls (14 girls and 14 boys). The sample size was inten- tionally kept relatively low, because of the type and amount of data we needed to collect for addressing the purpose of the study (for details, see data collection). Participants in the study were guaranteed anonymity and that it would not contribute to students’ ﬁnal grade. Re- searchers strongly argue that such an arrangement is important in order to allow students to comment freely on peer work (Topping, 2009). However, to avoid possible lack of motivation, students who made a good faith effort to complete all the requirements of the study were promised a book of their preference and participation in an excursion. It should be noted that this arrangement worked perfectly well, as all 28 participants completed all of the study’s assignments. Randomly matched participants worked in groups of two to create web-portfolios; group composition did not change during the intervention. All students had prior experience with reciprocal peer assessment. Speciﬁcally, they had participated in reciprocal peer assessments of web-portfolios whose content came from an environmental science context, similar to (but not the same as) the one involved in this study. All students received a speciﬁc set of assessment criteria to use when acting as peer assessors. Each criterion was explicitly deﬁned and discussed in class by the second author ahead of time, in order to establish common understanding about the criteria across all students. Training was also provided about the Likert scale (i.e., (1) unsatisfactory; (2) moderately satisfactory; (3) (fully) satisfactory) that accom- panied each assessment criterion. Speciﬁcally, students were explained what unsatisfactory, moderately satisfactory and (fully) satisfactory means for content, skill and appearance/organization related criteria. Right before the study, each participant was interviewed to ensure that they understood the assessment criteria both in terms of what they mean and what the requirements are for each criterion. In the case they were found not to understand an assessment criterion during the interview, that criterion was further discussed between the inter- viewee and the interviewer (with the ﬁrst author).",

It is important to argue, however, that validation of the method does not rely on the size of the sample, while results do. The pur- pose of this paper is to illustrate the proposed method, and in order to provide rigorous results, this method requires collaborations among researchers in different projects to build large data sets. Beyond these limitations, some other questions might also concern educational researchers and are worth discussing. Context is critical to the success of student learning and is important to be understood. Does this method push contexts away in the analysis? It does not. In opposite, synthesis across designs and contexts adds another layer of scrutiny and enables researchers to identify features that are most likely to work in different contexts. Educational studies are conducted in real learning environments and ﬁndings are warranted with all social and contextual factors included. However, due to effects of different contexts, results found under a speciﬁc context are hard to be gen- eralized in different contexts. Consequently, research ﬁndings are isolated. As a matter of fact, it has been the case. For example, reviewing 47 articles to examine trends in design research, Anderson and Shattuck (2012) found",

In response to the needs of twenty-first century learners, the educational software programs Teach, Learn, Evaluate! and Impromptu served as central components of the program’s curriculum.  Moreover,  drawing  on  educational  theories  that  value  general  learning  skills  as prerequisites to scholastic achievement, the In Harmony program provided a context in which students  could  improve  their  working  memory,  self-regulation,  and  cognitive  flexibility.  The model  was  adopted  internationally  in  Bloomington,  IN  and  Jaffa,  Israel,  and  featured  individual tasks  administered  through  computer  software,  as  well  as  group  music  composition  activities. By  incorporating  computer  technology  within  the  program’s  design,  and  targeting  the  above- mentioned learning skills, we sought to strengthen the impact of the music lessons and deepen our understanding of the mechanisms linking music education and enhanced cognitive development. Quantitative  and  qualitative  evaluation  of  the  children’s  working  memory,  self-regulation,  and cognitive  flexibility,  as  well  as  qualitative  analyses  of  data  collected  during  the  intervention, indicated  that  the  In  Harmony  model  and  the  educational  software  used  successfully  scaffold musical instruction, with beneficial outcomes in fostering working memory, self-regulation, and cognitive flexibility.",

In all three phases of the study, the post-interview questionnaires contained items regarding the relevance of the simulation, perceived performance and participants’ motivation. With medians of 3 in all samples, students’ ratings regarding the relevance of the learning experience with the ETU simulator for the real-world interviews did not differ among the three evaluations. There was also no change from the post-simulation to the post-interview phase. Preparedness for the real-world interview based on the experience with the ETU learning environment and perceived performance were answered on a scale from 0 to 100. Whereas we found no signiﬁcant difference for pre- paredness (M ¼ 63.6/42.7/59.11, SD ¼ 11.4/29.3/19.7, Md ¼ 60/60/66 for BL/UT1/UT2), students’ feeling to be successful in accomplishing the real-world interview increased steadily over the three studies, with the highest value of M ¼ 68.38 (SD ¼ 15.15, N ¼ 16) reached in UT2. A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed a signiﬁcant difference between the BL (M ¼ 40, SD ¼ 32.15, Md ¼ 60, N ¼ 7) and UT2 (c2 ¼ 6.1, df ¼ 2, p ¼ .047; U ¼ 22, z ¼ (cid:2)2.29, p ¼ .022). Motivation was assessed via four questions in UT1 and UT2, which were aggregated to an overall motivation score. This mean score could then be compared to the single score collected in the BL phase. In the post-interview phase all but one rating reached a median of 3 (on 4pt. rating scales). Average ratings are depicted in Fig. 8. As only exception, UT2 participants indicated to be very motivated (Md ¼ 4) to perform a good interview. Mann–Whitney-U tests for the four single items and a Kruskal Wallis test for overall motivation showed no signiﬁcant differences between the samples. In UT2, we used the post-interview survey to gather further user feedback on open issues identiﬁed from the cohort and post-simulation surveys. Five questions tried to ﬁnd out learners’ attitudes towards the two different simulation modes and reasons for waiving the op- portunity of exploring the simulation in the practice mode. Moreover, users’ opinion on the possibility to take reﬂection notes and on the smiley-based tool (SAM) for affect reporting was queried by three questions in each case. From the 19 participants responding to the post-interview survey, 65% indicated to have used both assess and practice mode. Reasons for using only the assess mode referred for the most part to time constraints. From the students using both modes, 55% said they have learned more in the assess mode and that they would prefer the assess mode for future training. On the other hand, 60% indicated that they found the practice mode more helpful in preparing for the real-world clinical interview. Thus, there is no clear preference for one mode over the other. The questions whether students used the possibility to take (reﬂection) notes was afﬁrmed by only 12.5%; they indicated that the notes helped in structuring the agenda for the interview and to follow the options. Reasons for not making use of the note-taking were for the main part, that students didn’t perceive it as necessary or useful, but also that they have not been aware of this option. Response to the SAM-items collected in the post-interview survey of UT2, revealed that participants simply did not notice the smiley-based tool for indi- cating their emotions (16 out of 17 answered “No”). Its usefulness could therefore not be evaluated.",

Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) of these sequences of talk showed that after low cognition, high cognition, planning or evaluation, both low and high cognition were more likely (some effects lasted 6 conversation turns). After monitoring or positive relational activities (confirm, engage), low cognition was more likely. After a denial however, high cognition was less likely. These results suggest that metacognitive planning organizes subsequent cognitive activities and facilitates the transition between acquisition of knowledge and meaning making, while relational activities help enact them. These insights can inform micro-temporal theories of social regulation and shared knowledge construction.",

        "participants": " Participants In the larger study (Molenaar et al. 2011b), teachers rated students as low, middle or they high achievers based on their reading, writing and computer abilities. Then, created triads with one low-, one middle- and one high-achiever, with at least one boy and one girl. To control for classroom effects, we randomly assigned triads within each class to one of the three scaffold conditions: (a) none, (b) structuring, and (c) problematizing. As coding all conversation turns from all triads requires enormous time, labor and resources, we randomly drew a smaller sample of 18 triads (one in each scaffolding condition from each class) for this study. These 54 students (23 boys and 31 girls) were from six classes in three elementary schools. The three schools were comparable, all in outer city, suburban areas with a white, middle-class population. These 18 triads each worked together for 6 h, for a total of 108 h and 51,338 turns of talk (events). The students in this sample included 4th graders (9), 5th graders (27) and 6th graders (18). Virtual learning environment and assignment The e-learning environment in this study, Ontdeknet, supports students in their virtual collaboration with experts (Molenaar 2003). The experts shared information about their country with students, which the Ontdeknet editor edited and placed in the special informa- tion pages of each expert. The information students could consult was restricted to the expert pages in which they could also pose question to expert via a forum. The teacher gives the assignment and monitors students’ progress. Students collaborated at two levels: (a) with an expert in a virtual environment and (b) with one another face-to-face in small groups working together on one computer. The study consisted of eight lessons, each lasting one hour. In the first lesson, the students completed a pre-test (regarding knowledge about the country to be studied, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.88 for the Iceland test and 0.92 for the New Zealand test). Then, they received instructions about the assignment and the virtual environment. In the last lesson, the students completed two post-tests, a metacognitive knowledge test and the country knowledge test (same as the pre-test). All students received the same instructions and spent six hours on the assignment. During the middle 6 lessons, the triads worked on an assignment called “Would you like to live abroad?” Its goal was to explore a country of choice (New Zealand or Iceland), write a paper on their findings and decide if they would like to live in this country. Each triad worked on one computer and consulted their country expert (an inhabitant) information pages and by asking questions. The expert answered in his dedicated expert pages in the computer environment. Before writing a paper about the selected country, the students completed four sub-tasks: (a) introduce themselves to the expert, (b) write a goal statement, Dissecting sequences of regulation and cognition",

Such scaffoldings may inform stu- dents of crucial story elements and possible transitions among different elements. However, how these scaffoldings may inﬂuence story creation/writing activities is still not very clear. This study aims to understand and explore the relationship among rule-based scaffoldings, creative self-efﬁcacy and storytelling products. By gathering the stories developed by 53 sixth graders and their creative self-efﬁcacy in a quasi-experiment setting, this study investigated whether providing these rule-based scaffoldings may inﬂuence their performance and creative self-efﬁcacy. The results of this study indicated that with these rule-based scaffoldings, students produced better storytelling products in terms of content quality. However, the presence of story grammar rules also limited the students’ freedom of creative thinking, and thus reduced the creative self-efﬁcacy level at the early stage of learning to create stories. Such ﬁndings support that the rule-based scaffolding may be more helpful in facilitating storytelling in the idea exploration phase than in the generation phase. Educators may need to be cautious regarding the time point at which rule-based scaffoldings would be most effectively integrated with learning activities.",

        "participants": " Participants rules will grammar inﬂuence student storytelling activity. The participants were 53 sixth graders (12 years old) in northern in an elementary school Taiwan. They were monolingual students speaking Chinese and having common understanding about Chinese culture. They were chosen because they had adequate computer skills to deal with information technology – this school covered the application of information technologies such as computers and the Internet in a lesson per week from third grade onwards. However, none of the students had experi- enced any storytelling activity using computers or other technologies. Therefore, student reactions to and perceptions of these storytelling activities may well be helpful in understanding the research ques- tions of this study. Previous studies regarding the development of story grammars have conﬁrmed that there were developmen- tal differences related to story-structure knowledge. More speciﬁcally, Fagella-Luby et al. (2007) asserted that the story-structure knowledge may initially appear at the ﬁrst-grade level and become well developed at the sixth-grade level for typical readers. In the study by Mandler and Johnson (1977), they indicated that the story developed by the ﬁrst and fourth graders seems to place much weight on the outcomes of a story, but lacks characters’ attempts and reactions. Therefore, students older than these may have sufﬁcient story-structure knowledge to understand story grammars but still could not apply it in a sophisticated manner. Moreover, prior studies regarding children’s creative performance indicated a fourth-grade slump phenomenon, indicat- ing that children’s creativity performance decreased profoundly in the fourth grade (Plucker & Renzulli, 1999). Students in the late elementary grades show a longer general decline. This may be due to the sociali- zation and the change in school climates. It is thus worthwhile to understand the inﬂuence of the story grammars on students in the late elementary grades in the story creation activities. Therefore, this study selected sixth graders as the participants. Much of the literature has given special attention to the development in young children of creative think- ing as associated with storytelling (Antle, 2003; Decortis & Rizzo, 2002; Druin & Fast, 2002).

Sixty (N = 60) college students studied with MetaTutor for 120 min and took notes on hypermedia content of the human circulatory system. Log-ﬁles and screen recordings of learner-system interactions were used to analyze notes for several quantitative and qual- itative variables. Results show that most note-taking was a verbatim copy of instructional content, which negatively related to the post-test measure of learning. There was an interaction between prior knowledge and pedagogical agent scaffolding, such that low prior knowledge students took a greater quantity of notes compared to their high prior knowledge counterparts, but only in the absence of MetaTutor SRL scaffolding; when agent SRL scaffolding was present, the note-taking activities of low prior knowledge students were statistically equivalent to the number of notes taken by their high prior knowledge counterparts.

In this study we attempt to clarify some of the issues surrounding the controversy by calling attention to distinctions between: (a) type of instruction (direct or discovery); (b) type of knowledge to be acquired (domain-general or domain-speciﬁc); and (c) type of materials that are used (physical or virtual). We then describe an empirical study that investigates the relative effectiveness of the physical–virtual dimension. In the present study, seventh and eighth grade students assembled and tested mousetrap cars with the goal of designing a car that would go the farthest. Children were assigned to four different conditions, depending on whether they manipulated physical or virtual materials, and whether they had a ﬁxed number of cars they could construct or a ﬁxed amount of time in which to construct them. All four conditions were equally effective in producing signiﬁcant gains in learners’ knowledge about causal factors, in their ability to design optimal cars, and in their conﬁdence in their knowledge. Girls’ performance, knowledge, and effort were equal to boys’ in all conditions, but girls’ conﬁdence remained below boys’ throughout. Given the fact that, on several different measures, children were able to learn as well with virtual as with physical materials, the inherent pragmatic advantages of virtual materials in science may make them the preferred instructional medium in many hands-on contexts.

First, short duration visual cues which draw attention to solution- relevant information and aid in the organizing and integrating of it, facilitate both immediate problem solving and generalization of that ability to new problems. Thus, visual cues can facilitate re-representing a problem and overcoming impasse, enabling a correct solution. Importantly, these cueing effects on problem solving did not involve the solvers’ attention necessarily embodying the solution to the problem, but were instead caused by solvers attending to and integrating relevant information in the problems into a solution path. Second, this study demonstrates that when such cues are used across multiple problems, solvers can automatize the extraction of problem-relevant information extraction. These results suggest that low-level attentional selection processes provide a necessary gateway for relevant information to be used in problem solving, but are generally not sufﬁcient for correct problem solving. Instead, factors that lead a solver to an impasse and to organize and integrate problem information also greatly facilitate arriving at correct solutions.

In Experiment 1, we used this methodology to show that particular ﬁx- ation patterns correlate with success in solving the tumor-and-lasers radiation problem. Given this correlation between attention to a par- ticular diagram feature and problem-solving insight, we investigated participants’  cognitive  sensitivity  to  perceptual  changes  in  that  dia- gram feature. In Experiment 2, we found that perceptually highlight- ing  the  critical  diagram  component,  identiﬁed  in  Experiment  1, signiﬁcantly increased the frequency of correct solutions. Taking a sit- uated perspective on cognition, we suggest that environmentally con- trolled perceptual properties can guide attention and eye movements in  ways  that  assist  in  developing  problem-solving  insights  that  dra- matically improve reasoning.",

Taking a sit- uated perspective on cognition, we suggest that environmentally con- trolled perceptual properties can guide attention and eye movements in  ways  that  assist  in  developing  problem-solving  insights  that  dra- matically improve reasoning. Numerous researchers since the 1970s have developed methods of recording eye movements as a “window to the mind.” In particular, eye- tracking  is  useful  for  learning  about  the  on-line  process  of  diagram- based problem solving, which standard problem-solving measures like solution time and accuracy cannot address. Early studies showed some evidence that eye movements can correspond to inference making (Hun- ziker, 1970; Lenhart, 1983; Nakano, 1971). For example, Just and Car- penter  (1985)  found  that  gaze  patterns  across  visual  stimuli  reﬂected solution  strategies  for  mental  rotation  problems.  More  recently,  eye movement patterns have been found to reﬂect strategic aspects of prob- lem  solving  in  the  domains  of  geometric  reasoning  (Epelboim  & Suppes,  1997),  reasoning  about  mechanical  systems  (Hegarty,  1992; Hegarty & Just, 1993; Rozenblit, Spivey, & Wojslawowicz, 2002), and insight problem solving (Knoblich, Ohlsson, & Raney, 2001; see also Hodgson, Bajwa, Own, & Kennard, 2000). As in these studies, we used eye movements in an initial study to discover the attentional and perceptual processes that accompany the solution of a well-known insight problem: Karl Duncker’s (1945) radi- ation problem. In our second experiment, we tested for the reverse ef- fect:  how  perceptual  changes  that  elicit  shifts  of  visual  attention  to critical  diagram  features  might  themselves  facilitate  correct  infer- ences. Several theories of insight problem solving have proposed that directing attention to particular features of the problem is one key to generating insight. We evaluated whether a subtle perceptual change in  the  diagram  directed  attention  away  from  unhelpful  problem  fea- tures and thereby facilitated insight. It is known that cognition often directs  attention,  but  can  attention  sometimes  direct  cognition?  In other words, if we led problem solvers’ eyes to fodder, could we make them think? Address  correspondence  to  Michael  Spivey,  Department  of  Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; e-mail: spivey@cornell.edu. Insight problems are characterized as problems in which the solution cannot be logically induced. For non-insight problems, such as algebra problems, the strategy that seems the most intuitively likely to lead to a solution is typically correct; in contrast, the strategy that initially seems likely to be successful in solving an insight problem is typically incor- rect, which leads to an impasse. In a process uncorrelated with partici- pants’  expectations  for  their  own  performance  (Metcalfe  &  Wiebe, 1987), this impasse is then unpredictably overcome, leading to the solu- tion; problem solvers often experience their discovery of the solution as an unexpected Aha! sensation (Duncker, 1945; Kaplan & Simon, 1990). What leads to the impasse is generally agreed to be inappropriate con- straints  applied  to  the  problem  (Ormerod,  MacGregor,  &  Chronicle, 2002). Knoblich et al. (2001) proposed that these constraints come from the activation of knowledge elements from past experiences that are un- helpful and lead problem solvers to attempt intuitive but wrong strate- gies. The  critical  question  of  exactly  how  impasses  are  overcome  has been a topic of recent interest (Kaplan & Simon, 1990; Knoblich, Ohls- son, Haider, & Rhenius, 1999; Ormerod et al., 2002). Restructuring the initial misleading representation of the problem is  often  suggested  to  be  the  source  of  insight  (e.g.,  Duncker,  1945; Mayer, 1995). Knoblich et al. (1999) have proposed constraint relax- ation and chunk decomposition as mechanisms that support represen- tational  restructuring  by  activating  knowledge  in  working  memory that leads to revising the misleading initial representation in a way that can resolve the impasse. In more recent work, Knoblich et al. (2001) discussed the allocation of visual attention to the visual stimulus as an outcome of the representational restructuring process. But perhaps at- tention is more than just an outcome. Perhaps attention can itself facil- itate the restructuring process.",

In this paper, we review the development, key research findings, and systems that have evolved from AutoTutor. First, the rationale for developing AutoTutor is outlined and the advantages of natural language tutoring are presented. Next, we review three central themes in AutoTutor’s development: human-inspired tutoring strategies, pedagogical agents, and technologies that support natural-language tutoring. Research on early versions of AutoTutor documented the impact on deep learning by co-constructed explanations, feedback, conversational scaffolding, and subject matter content. Systems that evolved from AutoTutor added additional components that have been evaluated with respect to learning and motivation. The latter findings include the effectiveness of deep reasoning questions for tutoring multiple domains, of adapting to the affect of low-knowledge learners, of content over surface features such as voices and persona of animated agents, and of alternative tutoring strategies such as collaborative lecturing and vicarious tutoring demonstrations. The paper also considers advances in pedagog- ical agent roles (such as trialogs) and in tutoring technologies, such semantic processing and tutoring delivery platforms. This paper summarizes and integrates significant findings produced by studies using AutoTutor and related systems.",

With one of the groups supported by scaffold prompts and the other contrasting group not supported, the results showed that the two groups were active in their participation, but content analyses of the generated ideas in the transcripts showed that the group that was supported by scaffold prompts did not generate more divergent ideas than the contrasting group. However, evaluation of the generated ideas showed that there was more quality in the group of students who were supported by scaffold prompts.

Parental permission was obtained for each student prior to participation in the research. Design, materials, and procedures There were three experimental conditions at each of the four grade levels. The interactive condition involved participants interacting directly with an intelligent tutoring system by carrying on a dialogue with AutoTutor (112 participants). The monologue vicarious condition involved a virtual tutor asking one broad question at the outset of each topic and following this question with the sentences included in the ideal answer and expectations on that topic (116 participants). The dialogue condition involved a virtual agent asking a deep question presented by a second voice engine before each content sentence in the ideal answer and each sentence in the expectations (114 participants). All participants at each grade level were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions at the outset of their first session. After informed consent they were administered the Gates-McGinite reading test (MacGinitie et al. 2000), followed by a pretest. A 26 (three or four foil) multiple-choice questions (chance = 7 correct) was presented to participants asked to learn Newtonian physics. The test was developed by VanLehn et al. (2007) and was similar to the Force Concepts Inventory (Hestenes et al. 1992). A second version this test, used to evaluate learning gains, was administered at the completion of the study.

How  can  instructional designers  know  whether  a  given  diagram  will  enhance  learning?  We  have  developed  a framework  of  three  factors  that  influence  the  effectiveness  of  a  diagram  in  a  particular learning  situation:  the  learning  objective,  the  design  of  the  visual  representation  and  the cognitive  processing  of  the  learner.  In  a  randomized-design  study  conducted  in  a  college chemistry class, we found that instruction that included diagrams created with this framework led to enhanced performance on open-ended transfer items compared to traditional instruction, particularly for low-performing students. We propose that a concept-based cognitive theory of multimedia learning that includes a conceptual working memory component may explain why the efficacy of diagrams depends heavily on the prior knowledge of the learner as well as the conceptual information available in the representation.",

The participants were students of two chemistry classes (n = 27, n = 22) at the beginning of Year 11, the first year in which the students studied chemistry as a separate discipline. The classes attended  three  70-minute  lessons  per  week.  Chi-squared  tests  showed  that  both classes had similar distributions of gender, ability, and language backgrounds, and therefore the two classes could be treated as one cohort for the purposes of analysis of  the  data  presented  here.  The  participant  classes  were  chosen  from  the  Year  11 chemistry cohort at the selected school based on the ability to timetable both classes into chemistry and computer laboratories with equal access and the need to avoid times that might lead to disruption of the classes. The study focused on particular instructional and scaffolding strategies that emphasised chemistry representations to enhance students’ learning. The instructional styles of the timetabled chemistry teach- ers for these two classes varied with one favouring student-centred approaches and the other transmissive teaching. Neither had experience in using digital technologies in the ways intended in the study. To eliminate the concern that teacher differences might influence the outcomes, the classes were taught by the researcher, a teacher with over 20 years experience in teaching senior chemistry.",

The study extends known research by examining the use of dynamic representations instead of static representations and it examines the role of the complexity of the domain and the learning environment. In three experimental conditions, the same learning environment, that of the physics topic of moments, was presented with separate, non-linked repre- sentations (S-NL condition), with separate, dynamically linked representations (S-DL condition), and with integrated, dynamically linked representations (I-DL condition). The learning environment was divided into low complexity and high complexity parts. Subjects were 72 students from middle vocational training (aged 16e18). Overall, the I-DL condition showed the best learning performance. Subjects in the I-DL condition, compared to the S-NL condition, showed better learning results on posttest items mea- suring domain knowledge. A trend in favor of the I-DL condition compared to the S-NL condition was found on posttest items measuring subjects’ ability to translate between different representations. A subjective measure of experienced difﬁculty showed that subjects in the I-DL condition experienced the learning environment as easiest to work with. The complexity of the learning environment and domain interacted with the effects of the experimental conditions. Differences between conditions were only found on the test items that corresponded to the high complexity part of the learning environment. (cid:1) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In addition to the common information available to all partic- ipants, each participant is given additional information corresponding to the expert role assigned to the participant. Three expert roles are used in the Red Cross res- cue scenario: Weapons, Environmental, and Intelligence. Information corresponding to each expert role provides details such as tide timing, transportation capacity, and fuel range. Furthermore, to simulate an uncertain and changing scenario, participants are provided with new information about the island and the guerilla forces at ﬁxed times when the Red Cross rescue scenario is conducted. Participants are asked to come up with a realistic COA that meets all of the mission’s objectives (successful evacuation, avoiding harm to the local villages on the island, and avoiding unnecessary contact with the enemy). Participants use a standard instant messaging environment to communicate with each other. A screenshot of the com- munication environment is shown in Figure 2. On the left-hand side, the environment provides a typical chat environment that allows participants to communicate with each other and the agent using text messages. On the right-hand side, the environment pro- vides a shared workspace that allows participants to collaboratively construct the COA for the rescue. They can also refer to the list of available military assets and the island map within the other tabs on the righthand side of the environment.

        "participants": " participants), this initially produces a summary of the distribution of turns over a whole interaction (e.g. telling us  that  all  participants  participated  equally),  but  giving  us  no  idea  of  change.  By  taking  the  smallest  possible time-period (1 turn), the values of this distribution become very noisy (during a single turn, a single participant has  100(cid:31)  of  the  participation  and  the  identity  of  this  participant  changes  at each  turn),  telling  us,  that,  at  this micro  level,  interactions  are  very  irregular.  During  a  small  portion  of  an  interaction,  however,  two  of  the participants  might  be  monopolizing  the  discussion,  producing  a  45(cid:31)45(cid:31)  distribution  for  them,  with  the remaining 10(cid:31) of turns contributed by the remaining participants. Sliding window visualizations show how the distribution  changes  over  time  throughout  the  interaction.  As  this  window  slides  over  times,  it  gradually “leaves” certain events out of the calculation of the indicator, and “introduces” new ones. At each iteration, the indicator  is  calculated  for  that  window  and  plotted.  The  size  of  the  window  produces  a  certain  amount  of © ISLS 364 ICLS2012 Volume 1: Full Papers smoothing or “blurring”, with one extreme being the window over the whole interaction (equivalent to the usual summary statistics) and the other being the jumpiness of the value per event. Our  approach  differs  from  other  visualization  approaches  (e.g.  (cid:31)ermann,  Mullins,  Nuessli,  & Dillenbourg,  2011(cid:31)  Hmelo-Silver,  Chernobilsky,  &  Nagarajan,  2009(cid:31)  Suthers  et  al.,  2010)  in  that  we automatically  make the transition in granularity from the turns or  events  which are present in the raw data.  In order to compensate for this (as there is no reason that there should be any comparability in terms of interactive and learning processes between two windows just because they contain the same number of events or the same amount of time), we provide the means to change the amount of smoothing (the size of the window) on the fly. Furthermore,  we  implement  these  visualizations  within  the  Tatiana  analysis  framework  (Dyke,  Lund,  & (cid:31)irardot,  2009(cid:31)  Dyke,  Lund,  &  (cid:31)irardot,  2010),  which  provides  synchronization  between  visualizations, allowing a human analyst to transition from the visualization to the raw data and back. In this way, any salient irregularities can be examined, verified to not be an artifact of smoothing at a particular granularity, and be used as  a  means  of  diving  into  the  raw  data.  The  interactive  nature  of  our  visualizations  distinguish  them  from existing work in CSCL which has examined change over time (e.g. Wang & Ros(cid:31), 2007). In accordance  with the  Tatiana data  model,  each event has a  certain number of properties, including, when applicable, a (cid:31)(cid:31)n(cid:31)(cid:31)n(cid:31)(cid:31), which is the message, utterance or text for that event. In order to introduce a certain amount  of  genericity  in  these  visualizations,  any  ad-hoc  indicator  can  be  computed,  with  default  indicators showing  number  of  turns  and  number  of  words,  as  distributed,  not  only  among  participants  (one  of  the  key properties  of  an  event),  but  also  among  other  properties,  such  as  a  set  of  codes  (e.g.  ontask  and  offtask).  We furthermore provide the means to view each visualization either in absolute numbers (A had 5 turns, B had 10) or in proportions (A had 1(cid:31)3, B had 2(cid:31)3). Social Con(cid:31)ersational A(cid:31)ents (cid:31)or Sca(cid:31)(cid:31)ol(cid:31)in(cid:31) CSC(cid:31) To illustrate the  ways in  which such  visualizations can be exploited,  we  will perform  a secondary analysis on the dataset analyzed by  Ai et al. (2010). This research was conducted to investigate how conversational agents (chatbots) can be used, not only to script the content of a collaborative discussion task, but also to provide social support  to  groups  (such  as showing  solidarity,  precipitating  tension-release,  and  agreeing).  It  also  investigates the effect of bias and alignment with student goals, in a situation where students are given competing goals. The study  builds  on  an  activity  for  which  it  had  already  been  shown  that  providing  social  support  produced  a significant effect on learning (Kumar, Ai, Beuth, & Ros(cid:31), 2010). In this activity, students must design a Rankine cycle  (a  type  of  power  plant),  working  in  pairs  to  understand  the  trade-offs  between  power  output  and environmental friendliness. The study was conducted in a 3x3 factorial design across 53 pairs of students in which two aspects of the  conversational  agents  were  manipulated.  The  first  was  the  amount  of  social  support: None,  Low  (at  most 15(cid:31) of agent turns are social), and High (at most 30(cid:31)). The second was the goal-alignment: (cid:31)reen, Power, and Neutral.  In  all  conditions,  the  agents  guide  the  students  through  a  carefully  designed  script  going  through  a series of 4 KCDs ((cid:31)n(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)n(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)n(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)), each of which discusses a parameter of the cycle and its implications:  Tmax  (maximum  temperature),  Pmin,  Pmax  (minimum,  maximum  pressure)  and  fuel.  The wording of these dialogues is slightly different in the (cid:31)reen and Power conditions to highlight the influence of these  parameters  on  environmental  friendliness  and  power  output  respectively.  For  example,  where  the  (cid:31)reen agent might say “What is bad about increasing the heat input to the cycle is that it increases the heat rejected to the  environment.”  The  neutral  tutor  would  simply  say  “Increasing  heat  input  to  the  cycle  increases  the  heat rejected to the environment.” After each KCD, the tutor prompts the students to discuss which value they would like to choose for that parameter and gives them a few minutes to conduct this discussion. At the end, the tutor concludes by prompting the students to review their choices for each parameter and come up with a final design. Students  worked  in  pairs,  with  each  pair  having  a  student  whose  goal  was  to  maximize  power  output  and  a student whose goal was to maximize environmental friendliness. Thus, each student can be considered to either be in the Match, Mismatch or Neutral condition, depending on their goal and that of the agent. In  the  original  analysis,  the  learning  gains  between  pre-  and  post-tests  were  evaluated  across  each  of the  9  conditions,  as  was  the  amount  of  offtask  behaviour,  the  amount  of  agent  abuse  (the  agent  sometimes makes remarks at inappropriate times, leading the students to comment on how  much they disliked it), and the amount of social behaviour.

The collaborative annotating technique is based on collaborative annotations made by peers while the data mining technique is used to identify the learning bottlenecks suf- fered by most students on a formative assessment. The ASIFA system combines these two techniques, deemed as scaffolding learning, to furnish students with adequate annotations to clarify their confused concepts on formative assessments and to further improve their learning achievements on summative assessments. Finally, some experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system and investigate the effects of the students’ behaviors of inputting and reviewing annotations on learning achieve- ments.

In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored signiﬁcantly higher and spent much less time in ﬁnding answers to the questions presented.

Specifically, we examined the independent and interactive effects of problem-solving prompts and reflection prompts on college students’ problem solving and writing within a Web-based instructional module. We found that students who received problem-solving prompts solved problems and wrote with more clarity than did students who did not receive problem solving prompts. Reflection prompts also positively influenced problem solving and writing, but only when students also received the problem solving prompts. This suggests that asking student to reflect on their work has a positive influence on students’ problem solving, but only when they have clear understanding of what they are being asked to reflect on.

The first factor was problem-solving prompts. Students either received or did not receive prompts designed to scaffold the problem-solving processes. An example of a question prompt was, “What do you see as the primary problem?” The second factor was reflection prompts. Students either received or did not receive prompts designed to encourage reflection and evaluation of their problem-solving approaches. An example of a reflection prompt was, “How certain are you that you have identified the primary problem?” We selected this sample because we felt it was a good representation of typical pre-service teachers, the population we are primarily concerned with in this study. Results from a pre-experimental questionnaire indicated that experi- mental groups were statistically equivalent with respect to age, class standing, technology use, and prior knowledge of educational psychology, psychology, and classroom management (the instructional topic). On average, students were between 18 and 21 years of age, were of junior standing, had completed less than one Educational Psychology, less than one Educational Technology course, possessed “a lot” of technology experience, and possessed “little knowledge” of educational psychology and classroom management, the instructional topic. In addition to the demographic and prior knowledge scales, we assessed students’ pre-experimental academic self-efficacy as well as self-reported meta- cognitive awareness (see Table 1). Results of these analyses indicated no differ- ences among groups in terms of self-reported academic self-efficacy, knowledge of cognition, or control of cognition. On average, students reported that they were moderately efficacious about their learning, were generally aware of their own cognition, and reported having moderately high levels of control over their cognition (see Table 1). Despite random assignment, there were differences among groups prior to experimentation. These differences included self-reported overall and academic major grade point averages.

Children whose parents had explained were most likely to have a conceptual as opposed to procedural understanding of the task. Study 2 examined the causal effect of parent explanations on children's understanding by randomly assigning children to conditions in which they were or were not provided explanation while exploring a novel task with an adult.

There were 26 boys and 38 girls. Thirty-five children were between 3- and 5-years old (M = 4.26 years, SD = .78 years), and 29 children were between 6- and 8-years old (M = 6.76 years, SD = .74 years). The study sample was generally representative of the museum population, which is predominately Caucasian and middle-class. Twenty-three children were randomly assigned to use the zoetrope by themselves and 41 children were assigned to use it with their parents. Roughly twice as many were assigned to the parent condition because, based on prior studies (Crowley, Callanan, Jipson, et al., 2001) and pilot work, we had expected about half of parents to spontaneously explain to their children. Thus, we anticipated that we would end up with three similarly sized groups for analyses—children with parents who explained, children with parents who did not explain, and solo children. Parents of children in the PE and PNE groups answered questionnaires regarding how often the families visit the museum and their prior experience with the exhibit. Families in the PE and PNE groups reported similar habits of visiting the museum. It was the first visit to the museum for about 30% for both groups, 30% reported visiting twice each year or less, and about 15% reported visiting three times per year or more (25% of families did not provide this information). The zoetrope exhibit was in storage prior to data collection for both studies; therefore families would not have had any recent experience with the exhibit. Additionally, only approximately 18% of PE and PNE parents reported that they believed their children had seen the zoetrope previously.",

This  questionnaire  is  a  modified  version  of  the  Chemistry  Classroom  Learning Environment Inventory (CCLEI) validated and used in the past in a study in Israel (Kesner et al., 1997; Hofstein et al., 2000). The measure was content-validated by a group of seven experts from the Science Teaching Department of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. As a result we obtained six scales, three referring to perceptions of the classroom learning environ- ments and three referring to attitudes towards learning chemistry aspects. The ques- tionnaire  and  all  of  its  dimensions  were  found  reliable  (see  Tables  2  and  3).  The reliability coefficient α Cronbach of the understanding scale (Table 3) is rather low (0.76). It could be explained by the relatively small number of items in this scale. In addition based also on the literature (e.g. Wiediger & Hutchinson, 2002) and from our own observations we suggest that often students have difficulties in assessing their own  understanding.  Thus  the  results  are  not  conclusive.  This  phenomenon  it  is suggested could affect the reliability of the study, resulting in moderate to law reliabil- ity coefficient.

We discuss these features and evaluate the effectiveness of this Web-based environment, focusing on different aspects of learning behaviour and tool usage.

Twenty surgeons with limited experience in laparo- scopic surgery (median 4·5 (range 0–8) cholecystectomies) participated in the study. All participants performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, supervised by an experi- enced surgeon. The trainees were then randomized to either a group that received training in a VR computer simulator or a control group that did not receive train- ing. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes. VR training included ten repetitions of all six tasks of the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer – Virtual Real- ity (MIST-VR; Mentice Medical Simulation, Gothenburg, Sweden)4. The six tasks are of progressive complexity and are designed to simulate the techniques used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All tasks begin with bilat- eral movements to touch a virtual sphere with the tips of the virtual instruments. For task 1 the trainee is required to grasp a virtual sphere and place it in a virtual box. In task 2 the virtual sphere is grasped, transferred between instruments and then placed in the box. Task 3 consists of grasping alternately the segments of a virtual pipe. Task 4 requires the trainee to grasp the virtual sphere, touch it with the tip of the other instrument, withdraw and reinsert this instrument, and once more touch the sphere. In task 5, once the virtual sphere has been grasped, three plates appear on the surface of the sphere, 90◦ apart; these are then touched by the other instrument and, using the pedal, virtually diathermied away. Task 6 combines the actions of tasks 4 and 5 with the aim of diathermying the plates while holding the sphere in the virtual box. Within 14 days after the initial operation, all partic- ipants performed another laparoscopic cholecystectomy, supervised by an experienced surgeon who was blinded to the training status. The procedures performed by the surgical trainees were videotaped and assessed by two senior surgeons highly experienced in laparoscopic surgery.

The present study examines the efficiency of rich and basic feedback in computer-based learning (CBL) materials used in an introductory accounting topic based on a student’s prior knowledge of accounting. In the context of cognitive load theory, the results showed that the rich feedback was significantly more useful for students  with  no  prior  knowledge,  and  that  there  was  no  significant  difference between the rich and basic feedback for students with a prior knowledge.",

Third-grade children (N = 57) received instruction in CVS via one of four possible orderings of high or low instructional guidance: high followed by high (HH), high followed by low (HL), low followed by high (LH), and low followed by low (LL). High guidance instruction consisted of a combination of direct instruction and inquiry questions, and low guidance included only inquiry questions. Contrary to the frequent claim that a high degree of instructional guidance leads to shallow learning and transfer, across a number of assessments—including a 5-month post-test—the HH group demonstrated a stronger understanding of CVS than the LL group. Moreover, we found no advantage for preceding high guidance with low guidance. We discuss our ﬁndings in relation to per- spectives advocating ‘‘invention as preparation for future learning’’, and the efﬁcacy of ‘‘productive failure’’.",

A technical report (Tatar & Stroter, 2009) examined the diversity of the seventh- and eighth-grade samples, as well as their representativeness relative to broader populations. The samples were diverse in terms of campus poverty level, school size, and campus ethnicity. They were also diverse in terms of teachers’ gender, ethnicity, years of teaching experience, highest degree ob- tained, and mathematical knowledge. Comparisons were made to the popula- tion in the Texas regions in which the experiments were conducted, as well as to the state of Texas as a whole. For all variables for which we had data at the regional and state levels, the ranges and means were similar among our sam- ples and the middle school mathematics teaching population by region and in the state. Note that the low percentages of African American teachers and stu- dents, as well as schools from large urban settings, reflect their small popula- tions in the regions in which the experiments were conducted. Further studies may be needed to examine generalizability of findings to those populations. Whereas 7 of the 20 geographical regions in Texas participated in the studies, of particular note is the participation of Region 1 because of its unique demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Region 1 is in the Rio Grande Valley, adjacent to the Mexican border. It has one of the highest poverty levels in the United States and is predominantly Hispanic. Region 1 participated in the Seventh-Grade Studies; however, because of a shift in local circumstances in the year between recruitment for the two experiments (i.e., the region received a large grant for a major reform in mathematics instruction), the region did not participate in the Eighth-Grade Experiment. While there was overall attrition in each of the studies, there is evidence that attrition was not differential across experimental groups. In the Seventh- Grade Studies, 140 teachers were accepted into the study, 117 attended the workshop (16% attrition), 95 teachers completed Year 1 (23% attrition), and 67 teachers completed Year 2 (29% attrition). When asked why they dropped from the program, teachers reported reasons that were not related to the project itself (e.g., reassignment or promotion, personal reasons, relocation). In the sample of 95 classrooms that completed the Year 1 experiment, there were no statistically significant differences between groups on any of the stu- dent-, teacher-, or school-level variables we examined. For the Seventh-Grade Quasi-Experiment, we considered data from only the 30 delayed-treatment teachers who finished both Year 1 and Year 2. In a quasi-experiment in which participants are not randomly assigned to treat- ment groups, the primary internal threat to validity is the possibility of non- equivalence of groups, which we examined between years at the student level (the teachers and schools were the same each year). The groups were equivalent with respect to all variables except gender. This difference is not a strong threat to the validity of the study; as shown below, the base- line assessment scores were equivalent across the groups, and gender was not shown to significantly predict student learning.",

This study examined the potential of a hypermedia based expert tool to scaffold regular education sixth graders engaged in a problem-based learning (PBL) program. Participants completed Alien Rescue, a hypermedia PBL environment on the solar system. The tool under investi- gation offered students interactive video of an expert modeling his cognitive processes as he performed tasks relevant to the development of a solution to the central problem of the PBL unit. Two other versions of the expert tool were developed to isolate the effect of the cognitive modeling. Results suggest that the cognitive modeling offered through the expert tool brought the way students worked during periods of self-directed study into line with expert actions and impacted the quality of the rationales students wrote for their solutions.",

Therefore, children must continually validate their own problem-solving activity  in  light  of  their  partners'  activity,  always  striving toward mutual agreement. Although  it  cannot  be  guaranteed  that  any  given  social interaction  will  lead  to  a  beneficial  conflict  of  centrations, there is some evidence that the Logo environment  is condu- cive to such  interaction.  It has been  demonstrated  that  peer interactions  focused  on  learning  and  problem  solving  are more prevalent in Logo environments than in others, such as traditional  classroom  tasks  or computer-assisted  instruction (CAI) drill (Clements, 1986). In addition, Logo environments engender  conflict,  and,  more  importantly,  negotiation  and resolution  of that  conflict  (Clements & Nastasi,  1985,  1988; Lehrer & Smith, 1986). Research has also indicated that  social interaction  may be facilitated when students are paired within CAI environments (Muller & Perlmutter,  1985; Swigger,  Campbell,  & Swigger, 1983).  However,  it  is possible  that  in  certain  CAI environ- ments children are more likely to maintain their own egocen- tric  points  of  view.  In  these  environments,  the  computer structures the problem, the solution process, and the interac- tion.  Children  working  together  may have  different  percep- tions, and yet they  may respond  in  turn  to the  computer's queries  without  reaching  interpersonal  agreement.  Previous research comparing Logo and drill-and-practice CAI, for ex- ample, indicated that children in CAI spent less time engaged in cooperative rule-making and conflict resolution (Clements & Nastasi,  1985, 1988). In CAI, one child's  response is not necessarily  contingent  on,  or  even  related  to,  the  other's. Therefore,  although  social interactions may be facilitated by both  environments,  those  focused  on  problem  solving and conflict  resolution  may occur  more frequently  in Logo than in CAI environments.",

The aim of the questionnaire to participating IT scholars was to identify factors contributing to the difﬁculty of IT programming from an IT scholar perspective. Feedback from IT teacher and scholar surveys conﬁrmed the ﬁndings from literature and identiﬁed additional criteria to be applied when selecting an appropriate PAT to support the learning of IT programming. The feedback from the surveys to IT teachers resulted in a comprehensive set of criteria as follows: (cid:2) Promotes self-study in a constructivist way: IT teachers identiﬁed that the class lessons were short resulting in less time in class to practise programming with the assistance of the IT teacher. Scholars should thus be able to use a PAT without the assistance of the teacher to develop their knowledge and explore different programming concepts.

This was a convenience sample in that the teacher had worked with us before and the school provided access to a fully equipped computer laboratory in which we could conduct our research with entire classrooms. The classroom teacher has been an active participant in the BioWorld project for several years. She volunteered to use BioWorld in two of her grade 9 biology classes, which she stated were of comparable ability level. This grade level is appropriate for investigating reasoning due to the variety of new scientiﬁc reasoning skills that develop and consolidate at the same time (Schauble et al., 1995). The teacher allowed students to choose their own partners for collaborative work, resulting in 20 groups in all. The entire sample was used for the ﬁrst two research ques- tions, whereas a subset of this sample was examined for the ﬁnal research question. The sample was reduced for the third question since the teacher and researcher could only coach one group per classroom. Data from 6 groups were consequently examined; 3 groups from each classroom, resulting in 2 teacher-guided groups, 2 graduate student investigator-guided groups, and 2 BioWorld-only groups. The teacher selected these 6 groups as being 167 equivalent in terms of their previous grades and ability to articulate their understanding. The teacher was an experienced biology teacher who has used BioWorld in her classrooms. The graduate student was part of the BioWorld design team who had experience in both the content knowledge and the types of reasoning possible within BioWorld, but whose knowledge of general biology was limited. The groups without human coaches relied on each other to reason through problems and they also had access to an on-line consult button that provided general hints that they could use to help them solve the problem.",

Other studies (e.g., Guzdial & Turns, 2000; Hara et al., 2000; Hewitt & Teplovs, 1999; Lahti, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, & Hakkarainen, 2003) have reported problems with inten sity of participation and the depth of engagement?for example, unevenness of participation, shortness of discourse threads, the teacher's overly important posi tion in discourse, lack of reciprocity, or absence of a clear pedagogical perspective in the design of computer-mediated educational settings. The research presented in this article has been motivated by prior research prominent in the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) literature, which has repeatedly argued for the benefits of distributed expertise and collabora tive knowledge building. Most of the reported research on inquiry learning, how ever, has taken place in primary or secondary education. Furthermore, it has often been difficult to distinguish the precise role of the technology-mediation, whether the results have been affected by exceptional efforts on the part of teachers or stu dents or whether the results obtained in laboratory settings would be the same in This content downloaded from (cid:0)132.174.254.159 on Thu, 21 Jul 2022 15:19:54 UTC(cid:0)",

The purpose of the present study was to conﬁrm previous research ﬁndings that diﬀerent categories of Web-based pedagogical tools (WBPT) (e.g., collaborative and communication tools, content creation and delivery tools) supported diﬀerent self- regulated learning (SRL) processes (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring), and to further examine which WBPT were most eﬀective in supporting student SRL while completing course assignments. The sample surveyed consisted of 65 students enrolled in three distributed courses. A mixed methods methodological approach was implemented. As expected, quantitative analyses conﬁrmed that diﬀerent WBPT supported diﬀerent SRL processes. In addition, analyses of qualitative data collected revealed that WBPT were highly eﬀective in activating the use of SRL processes necessary to support speciﬁc types of learning tasks required for completion of course assignments. Educational implica- tions for using WBPT as scaﬀolds for SRL are discussed.",

They concluded that a potential theoretical account for the novice-to- expert shift in the performance is not due to shift in problem-solving strategy (e.g., from BC to FC), but a shift from so called unguided FC to schematic FC.  These studies support teaching FC rather than BC for students learning problem solving skills. On  the  other  hand,  there  are  some  conflicting  studies  that  claim  that  the  novices  rely  on backward  chaining  whereas  the  experts  prefer  to  forward  chaining.    When  observing  novices solving  Kinematics  problems,  for  example,  Larkin  et  al  found  that  the  novices  tend  to  apply backward  chaining  (Larkin,  McDermott,  Simon,  &  Simon,  1980).    “The  management  of  goals and subgoals [is] deciding periodically what to do next” (Larkin et al., 1980, p.1338).  Unlike the experts,  the  novices  do  not  apply  schematic  knowledge  (M.  T.  H.  Chi,  Feltovich,  &  Glaser, 1981), hence tend to rely on analytic goal-directed strategy.  This strategy apparently affects the experts’ performance as well so that the “experts work forwards only on easy problems” (Larkin et al., 1980, p.1338).  There is also a computational model of novice-expert shift from backward to forward chaining called  EUREKA (Elio & Scharf, 1990).  The EUREKA model predicts that the  strategy  change  occurs  when  the  content  of  the  problem  solving  principles  (or  schemas,  if",

It discusses the design of an RBLE in the classroom by selecting an appropriate context with the assistance of computer-mediated learning resources and tools and employing the inquiry learning approach as the ped- agogy. This study reports on the creation of the RBLE within the learning context of family trees. The computer-mediated learning resources and tools comprise three components: an audio-visual database for guided and coupled inquiry, an interactive interface for conceptualising the nomenclature and a tool for learners to construct their own family trees. Scaﬀolds were designed for an inquiry mode of learning and teaching to support the use of the resources and tools in learning about family trees. The learning and teaching process, including the outcomes for learners, through the RBLE with inquiry learning approach are studied. The ﬁndings of an interview and a pre-test/post-test study indicate that the RBLE can assist learners to build knowledge of family trees. The role of teachers in such an environment is to guide and encourage learners to inquire during the learning process. (cid:2) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The task involved a collaborative computer-based modeling task. In order to test the model, group measures of mastery-approach goal orientation, performance-avoid- ance goal orientation, self-eﬃcacy, and achievement were employed. Students’ cognitive processing was assessed using an online log-ﬁle measure. As predicted, mastery-approach goal orientation had a signiﬁcant positive eﬀect on achievement, which was mediated through students’ use of deep pro- cesses. No signiﬁcant relationships could be found between performance-avoidance goal orientation and surface processing and between surface processing and achievement. Results are discussed with respect to general theoretical implications and lead to suggestions for the design of appropriate scaﬀolds. (cid:2) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "participants": " 2.1. Participants Sixty students (i.e., thirty dyads) from eleventh-grade pre-university education, with a major in science participated in our study. Their science teachers reported that they had no prior experience and hence no prior knowledge of dynamic modeling. The fact that they had chosen a major in science meant that they had followed four years of courses in several science topics, speciﬁcally in physics and chemistry, including an introduction to thermodynamics. This means they had encountered the concepts of heat, heat ﬂow, and temperature previously in their school career. These concepts are relevant to the task they performed in the study. They had not previously worked with models of global warm- ing. Students’ age ranged between 16–18 years. Participants were awarded € 20 for their participation. As dyad composition was not a variable in our model, we preferred a heterogeneous group composition, since in previous studies students with diﬀerent school grades had been generally more successful working together than homogeneous groups (e.g., Gijlers & Jong, 2005; Webb, 1991; Webb, Welner, & Zuniga, 2001). The reason is that higher achieving students can learn from giving explanations, whereas the lower achieving stu- dent can learn from these explanations given (Hooper & Hannaﬁn, 1991; Webb & Farivar, 1994). However, the diﬀerence in level between students should not be too large. As a mea- sure for group composition, we used the students’ average school grade in science. The mean average grade of all students was 7.10 on a scale from 1 to 10, with a standard devi- ation of 1.03. In order to assure moderately heterogeneous dyads, the group of partici- pants was divided into two equal groups. One group consisted of the top 25% as well as the bottom 25% in average grade for science. The other group consisted of the remain- ing 50%. Dyads were composed by letting students choose a partner from the other group. This assured a moderate diﬀerence between partners in science ability, as well as pairs who had chosen each other to work with. This procedure meant that half of the dyads were low–middle dyads in terms of average grade, whereas the other half was middle–high. Given the low variance in average school grade, as well as the fact that all students were new to the task, we did not expect any diﬀerences from this division.",

Succinctly, dyads of sixth-grade students were engaged in distributed collaborative inquiry regarding the scientific concepts of light, vision, and color in order to solve a mystery problem about a stolen diamond. ODRES was employed to scaffold students’ collaborative inquiry with different tools, such as the simulator that simulates the effects of the color of a light source on an object, the magnifying glass that enables students to make careful observations, and the notebook that organizes the results of students’ investigations. Students performed two cycles of collaborative inquiry, and each cycle was followed by a classroom discussion where students could present their solutions, share information, reflect, raise questions, and get  feedback about  their proposed  solutions.  The results showed that learning with ODRES positively affected students’ understandings and promoted a lasting effect on their conceptions. Moreover, the results provide useful guidance about how ODRES can be used as a learning tool in collaborative inquiry, and explain the role of discussion and investigation of inquiry processes at the level of a distributed cognitive system.  Implications  for  designing  distributed  educational  systems  for  children  are  finally discussed.

The sixth-grade classroom was selected randomly from three other sixth-grade classrooms that existed in the school. The school was also selected randomly from seven other schools for which we had permission from the Ministry of Education to visit and conduct research studies. The 18 students were from the same class (it was a small class of 18 students). The teacher did not participate in any of the research proce- dures. She helped us with setting up the classroom, she introduced us to the students, and she then let us conduct the study. Prior to the study, we visited, of course, the teacher and we explained to her what we wanted to do. She was excited about giving her students an opportunity to work in such an environ- ment, but she told us that because she did not have any experience with teach- ing in a technology-enhanced environment she did not want to teach the les- son—she wanted us to do it, so she could learn. Of the 18 participants, 11 were females and seven were males. According to the classroom teacher, the academic performance of four students was rated high, the academic performance of 10 students was rated medium, and the aca- demic performance of the remaining four was rated low to very low. Students were randomly divided into nine dyads—three dyads were of homogeneous ability and six of heterogeneous ability.  As shown in Table 2, two of the three homogeneous dyads (dyads 4 and 6) were of medium ability and the other (dyad 5) of low ability. The composition of the heterogeneous dyads varied across the three achievement levels as shown in Table 2. Most students had pre- vious but limited experience with computers, either in their school computer lab or in their homes, while some of them had no experience whatsoever.",

        "participants": " All participants did the GSAT math test, ATMI attitudes inventory, and Jr MAI metacognitive awareness inventory as a pretest. They then played eight ASTRA EAGLE math games during 10 two-hour sessions for ﬁve weeks. After ﬁve-week gam- ing treatment, all participants retook GSAT, ATMI, and Jr MAI in the posttest. The questions of the GSAT test in the posttest were the same as that in the pretest, but the sequence of the questions were shoveled. In-ﬁeld observation, analysis of participants’ game-playing records, and think-aloud verbal protocol were employed in the study to achieve a triangulation of qualitative data. Direct observation of the participants was conducted during every game-playing session. Concurrently, participants were asked to do think-aloud that helps to reveal their emotional situations and cognitive processes when interacting with game features, strategies to handle math problems in the games, and inten- tional or incidental knowledge constructed. Participants’ game-playing logs, indicating their time logged into the game and gaming scores, were archived and analyzed every week. Observation: The researcher closely observed participants’ behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, and facial expressions when they interacted with the computer program, peers, and the external environment. A semi-structured observation protocol was developed to guide the researcher’s attention during observation, though the actual observation was open to any situ- ational changes. Think-aloud: Based on Ericsson and Simon’s (1993) talk-aloud method, the researcher developed an open-ended protocol to facilitate participant thinking but not inﬂuence what they said. Participants were prompted to report whatever goes through their mind, such as what they were looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling, as they went about their task. The fol- lowing instruction was given: ‘‘As you play the computer game today, please keep talking out loud everything that you think or do in playing. Try to say everything that goes through your mind, such as your thoughts, feelings, and choices about what you are doing and reading on screen.” If the participants did not think-aloud, the researcher gave prompts like: ‘‘What are you doing now?” ‘‘Why did you do that?” ‘‘What made you arrive at this decision?” ‘‘How are you feeling?” or ‘‘So now you are. . .” Participants’ verbal protocols were recorded with a mini-sized digital recorder. Efforts were taken to enable partic- ipants to generate a self-report of on-going actions without being interrupted or biased. Document analysis: the computer game program recorded participants’ on-task time (the time when they logged-in the games), the numbers of math questions they had tried to solve, the questions they had solved correctly, and the gaming scores they earned. These records were collected every week and coded. Qualitative Data analysis: By following Yin’s (1984) proposition on the case study method, the researcher ﬁrst did within- case analysis to identify unique patterns within the data for the single case (participant), and then conducted cross-case the- matic analysis to categorize the similarities and differences across the participants in responses and activities, with the goal of ﬁnding the recurring themes and organizing the data into systematic categories of analysis. The statements or meaning units that emerged as possible commonalities from the data were forwarded as initial themes (Creswell, 1998) and coded using Nvivo software. The researcher then reﬁned these themes by removing overlapping ones and capturing the main thrust of each theme’s meaning (Guba & Lincoln, 1994). Through this data coding process, general themes or patterns emerged and were synthesized.",

The correlation analysis yielded an r2 of 0.91, supporting the use of the scoring protocol in the following analysis. Because of absences, not every student took both pre- and post-test; our overall N for the Inquiry Test analysis was 21. The mean scores on both the pre-test (19.2) and the post-test (22.0) were relatively good in all cases: maximum possible score was 32. This indicates that the students had a reasonable understanding of the inquiry process at the beginning, but that they improved over the course of the study. None of the students reached reached the maximum score on either the pre- or post-test. The Inquiry Test gain scores were analyzed using a Student’s t-test of signiﬁcance (see Table 1). Once it was shown that that students showed a signiﬁcant gain (p \\ 0.005) from pre- to post-test, with a moderate effect size (0.5 r), we broke the Inquiry Test scores into subscores by each step of the Inquiry Cycle. Table 1 shows the analysis of the total score, as well as the subscores. Students showed a signif- icant gain on the Hypothesize, Model and Evaluate steps of the inquiry process, an insigniﬁcant gain on the Investigate step, and a insigniﬁcant loss on the Analyze step.

Research has indicated that students in heterogeneous groups generally perform better than students in homogeneous groups (Webb, Nemer, & Zuniga, 2002), but the difference between students should not be too large (Gijlers & de Jong, 2005).

Dyads were randomly assigned to the two conditions: 13 dyads participated in the control condition and 12 dyads in the concept-mapping condition. Three dyads had to be excluded from the data anal- yses. We removed two dyads from the control condition. The first dyad was not able to complete the experimental session because of technical difficulties, and the second dyad was excluded because the students were not able to attend both sessions (pretest and experiment). One dyad from the concept-mapping condition was excluded from the analyses because one of the partners did not attend the complete experimental session. As a result, we analyzed five high/medium and six low/medium dyads for the control condition and six high/medium and five low/medium dyads for the concept-mapping condition.

Findings imply that the technologies have potential as a distance-learning platform and as a tool to meet elements of NETS•T.

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT Online  learning  technologies  and  virtual  learning  environments  in  particular  are  attracting considerable  attention,  and  are  likely  to  form  key  strategic  aspects  of  teaching  and  learning  science subjects at the post secondary level. Learners at various levels seem to enjoy the autonomy of gaining access to expertise through online communications and web-based resources. However, simply having access  to  knowledge  without  experience  does  not  seem  to  be  sufficient  for  the  development  of problem solving expertise and metacognitive control. This study investigated the effects of embedded metacognitive prompts on students' metacognitive awareness, and the effects of virtual tutoring on the development  of  students’  metacognitive  problem  solving  expertise  in  physics.  Virtual  tutoring environment  in  this  study  can  be  described  as  an  online  environment  that  consists  of  different metacognitive  scaffolds:  expert  modelling  on  digital  online  video,  access  to  procedural,  and  self- assessment prompts, and collaborative interaction among teachers and students on a WebCT platform. The  results  suggest  that  embedded  metacognitive  prompts  can  be  used  as  scaffolds  to  enhance learners' awareness of their ongoing thinking processes, and the need to plan their course of action and check  their  accuracy  as  they  progress  through  any  problem  solving  task.  It  also  appears  that externalizing the expert’s mental activities to the students can be an effective scaffolding strategy in guiding students’ attention to specific aspects of their learning processes, and engaging them in self- assessment of their own learning and understanding.",

Participants and settings As often is true in educational studies, it was impracticable for the investigators to randomly assign individual students to different treatments. Therefore, a quasi-experimental design (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2001) with non-randomly assigned experimental and control groups was employed. A total of 539 undergraduate students from a comprehensive university participated in this study which lasted for three consecutive semesters. There were 191 (male 57.6% and female 42.4%), 150 (male 53.7% and female 46.3%), and 198 (male 58.6% and female 41.4%) students registered in the ﬁrst, second, and third semester offerings of a course in physical science, respectively. Since this course was open to all undergraduate students, the participants had a broad range of majors: science, engineering, management, art and literature, and social science. In each semester, because of classroom capacity limitations, the students were divided into A and B classes by the ofﬁce of academic affairs of the university. Class A spent nine weeks with the ﬁrst author learning chemistry while class B was studying physics with another instructor. In the middle of the semester, the two instructors switched classes. All of the data were collected while the participants were in the chemistry class. This was a two-credit course meeting weekly for 2-h for 18 weeks. The goal of this course was to promote students’ scientiﬁc literacy in applying physics and chemistry content knowledge to daily life, science-related issues. Special attention was focused on education in argumentation over controversial socio-scientiﬁc issues (SSI). The emphasis in argumentation about SSI was intended to promote students’ understanding about the issues and their ability in making informed decisions and society. Three SSIs were used – construction of a nuclear power plant, promotion of genetically modiﬁed food, and expansion of crops for manufacturing bio- ethanol. The SSI about the promotion of genetically modiﬁed food is provided as a sample assignment in Appendix A.",

        "abstract": " Abstract: Powerful online visualizations can make unobservable scientiﬁc phenomena visible and improve student understanding. Instead, they often confuse or mislead students. To clarify the impact of molecular visualizations for middle school students we explored three design variations implemented in a Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) unit on thermodynamics: Observation, Research Guidance, or Critique. We tested these variations in an inquiry unit designed following the knowledge integration framework to promote coherent understanding. Seven middle school classes (205 students) and their two teachers participated in the study. Students studying each version of the unit made signiﬁcant gains on knowledge integration items designed to measure coherent understanding of thermodynamics. Compared to Research Guidance, the Critique condition was more successful, especially in helping students conduct consequential experiments. Embedded assessments revealed that students who critiqued a confounded experiment were more successful in conducting valid experiments than students who did not critique. In addition, the combination of critique and virtual experimentation increased student ability to connect molecular and observable phenomena. These results suggest design guidelines to help future designers. Speciﬁcally, preceding experimentation with critique activities helps students distinguish among existing and new ideas. # 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 50: 858–886, 2013",

        "participants": " Participants Participants were eighth graders in two public middle schools in North America (Table 2). At one school the science teacher implemented the Observation condition with her 60 students. At the other school classes were randomly assigned to the Critique (three classes with 83 students) or Research Guidance condition (two classes with 62 students). All students had studied the concepts of atoms and molecules before starting the investigation. The science standards in the state for public schools require that eighth grade students learn about the structure of matter including the concepts of atoms and molecules. We conﬁrmed with the teachers that the Thermo unit was implemented after the unit on structure of matter. The socioeconomic status of students’ families at both schools was above the average of the state. Both schools had low percentages of students receiving free lunch (<3%). The race/ ethnicity at the two schools differed: The comparison study school had 68% Asian American students, 26% Caucasian students, and 6% others. The Observation study school had 15% Asian American students, 61% Caucasian students, and 24% others. Both teachers attended the summer professional development workshop for the curriculum. The Observation condition teacher had taught the unit in the past. The comparison study teacher was using the unit for the ﬁrst time. The teachers collaborated on identifying teaching strategies for the unit. The teachers were comparable in terms of their background, experience teaching science, and instructional approach. Nevertheless, comparisons across teachers are not warranted due to possible confounds. Classroom Observations and Short Interviews The ﬁrst author conducted classroom observations during all class periods and provided technical assistance as necessary. Teachers participated in short interviews at the end of the unit where they were asked about their satisfaction with the instruction. We used this information to ensure the ﬁdelity of the implementation. The observations and short interviews documented whether each class completed the whole curriculum and whether the time spent on the curriculum was similar. They also documented similarities or differences in teaching strategies.",

We were interested in ﬁnding the ways hypermedia technology could be used as cognitive tools to share the responsibilities of teachers to provide necessary scaﬀolding to support students’ learning in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment. Of particular interest to this study was to understand if non-gifted students could succeed in a PBL environment where scaﬀolding was provided through technology in addition to that from a teacher. Since this environment was multimedia rich and game like, we also wanted to ﬁnd out if girls would perform as well as boys. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used. The ﬁndings have shown that the enriched presentation of the knowledge base and the more eﬀective delivery of cognitive tools through hypermedia technology have provided needed scaﬀolding to all students in the 6th grade classrooms. As a result, not only students in gifted education but also students in reg- ular education performed well in this technology enhanced PBL environment. In addition, students, who speak English as a second language or have some learning disability, also beneﬁted from using it. The amount of gain in students’ science knowledge and problem-solving skills was related to their prior knowledge level. This study has also indicated that due to a large amount of reading involved, slow readers found this PBL environment challenging. More support, via technology or teachers, is needed for these students. To our encourage- ment, and contrary to the recent computer attitude and gender research, no gender diﬀerence was found in the performance, nor in the attitudes among the students in this study. Girls performed equally well and had positive attitudes toward the PBL environment and learning science as a result of using it. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Currently, little is known about how students' cognitive processes are influenced by distinct instructional approaches. The study focused on two problem-based methods: conceptually-focused  instruction (CFT) and procedurally-focused  instruction (PFI). Both methods implemented common principles based on cognitive theories. Moreover, different  characteristics were identified in the cognitive theories having different research traditions as their source. These differences provided insights for devising the two instructional approaches.",

Scaffolding is an instructional support that helps learners solve problems, carry out tasks, or achieve goals that they are unable to accomplish on their own. Although support such as scaffolding is necessary when students engage in complex learning environments, many issues must be resolved before educators can effectively implement scaffolding in instruction. To achieve this, this dissertation includes two studies: a systematic literature review and an experimental study.",

        "abstract": " Abstract The portability and immediate communication properties of mobile devices inﬂuence the learning processes in interact- ing with peers, accessing resources and transferring data. For example, the short message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with timely and adaptive information access. Although many studies of mobile learning indicate the pedagogical potential of mobile devices, the screen size, computational power, battery capacity, input interfaces, and net- work bandwidth are too restricted to develop acceptable functionality for the entire learning processes in a handheld device. Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to ﬁll the gap between Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learn- ing. This study ﬁrst creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays, learners’ behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional plan- ning. A student model is then built according to the analytical results of learning portfolios and a concept map of the learn- ing domain. Based on the student model and learners’ available learning devices, three modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the ubiq- uitous learning website. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system can enhance three learning performance indicators, namely academic performance, task accomplishment rates, and learning goals achievement rates.

Authoring Affinity Learning lesson plans or hierarchies, however, is non-trivial. We have developed two authoring tools: the first tool provides an overall view of the hierarchy with a graphical display of the nodes and links; but the second tool does not. This article reports on a study conducted to test whether the graphical authoring tool can help produce better-quality hierarchies and also help the users learn about the subject matter better than the non-graphical authoring tool. Results show that while the graphical authoring tool can result in better-quality hierarchies, it does not result in better learning.",

This  study  compares  three  authentic approaches  to  teaching  a  science  unit  on  bird  adaptations  for  habitat  that  integrate thinking  skills  and  technology  skills:  a  problem-based  learning  approach  utilizing  the CoRT  Breadth  thinking  skills  (de  Bono,  2000);  a  thematic  approach  integrating  several subject areas using Talents Unlimited thinking skills (Schlichter & Palmer, 1993); and a process  skill-focused  approach  using  object  boxes  (Rule,  Barrera,  &  Stewart,  2004). Three  third  grade  classes  of  students  (N=60)  of  mixed  ability  and  Spanish/English proficiency  from  a  western  rural  community  participated  in  this  pretest-  intervention- posttest study. Posttest scores showed all classes gained in knowledge of bird facts and adaptations, descriptive vocabulary, curiosity, technology self-efficacy, and knowledge of computer  applications.  Problem-based  learning  students  showed  the  most  curiosity (measured  by  questions  generated  for  a  topic-related  image);  thematic  unit  students excelled  in  computer  application  knowledge;  while  object  box  students  showed  largest gains  in  science  knowledge,  vocabulary,  and  computer  self-efficacy.

Results from a year-long application of the approach with ﬁrst-year psychology students are presented. These show that the approach facilitates active student engagement throughout the academic year, and is associated with improved marks in the ﬁnal written exam.

As  such,  the  study  of complex systems has been recognized as a key idea in science education. However, we also know that learning about complex systems is hard because there are many systems concepts that we never directly experience or that violate our intuitions, and learning about these systems challenges our cognitive and metacognitive resources, restricting our ability  to  think  beyond  linear  flow,  single  causality,  and  visible  structure.  Motivated  by  the  problem  of  helping middle-school students gain a deeper understanding of complex systems, we have developed an interactive learning environment called ACT that enables construction of SBF models of complex systems in the domain of aquaria. SBF models are known to be useful for supporting creative design. From initial data on the introduction of ACT 2.0 into multiple middle-school classrooms in 2008, we may draw two preliminary  conclusions.  Firstly,  different  teachers  use  ACT  to  stimulate,  scaffold,  and  structure  SBF  thinking  in different ways, which of course has a major influence on the SBF models constructed by the students using ACT. In the section above, we described the way three different teachers structured their classes and illustrated some of the SBF models constructed by their students, respectively. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, preliminary results pertain to statistically significant improvement in understanding of the structure, behavior, and function of aquaria in our  sample  of  157  middle-school  students.

This  system  is  novel,  because  it  is  an  intelligent  equation-solving  tutor  that  combines  a cognitive  model  of  the  domain  with  a  model  of  dialog-based  tutoring.  The  tutorial  model  is based on the observation of an experienced human tutor and captures tutorial strategies specific to the domain of equation-solving. In this context, a tutorial dialog is the equivalent of breaking down problems into simpler steps and asking new questions before proceeding to the next step. The resulting system,  named E-tutor, was compared, via a randomized controlled experiment, to a traditional model-tracing tutor that does not engage students in dialog. Preliminary results using  a  very  small  sample  size  showed  that  E-tutor  capabilities  performed  better  than  the control.  This  set  of  preliminary  results,  though  not  statistically  significant,  shows  promising opportunities  to  improve  learning  performance  by  adding  tutorial  dialog  capabilities  to  ITSs. The system is available at www.wpi.edu/~leenar/E-tutor.",

In  order  to  foster  a  deep  understanding  of  do- main  principles,  we  developed  a  Cognitive  Tutor  that  con- tained,  on  the  basis  of  the  theoretical  rational  of  example- based  learning,  faded  worked-out  examples.  We  conducted two experiments in which we compared the example-enriched Cognitive  Tutor  with  a  standard  Cognitive  Tutor.  In Experiment  1,  we  found  no  significant  differences  in  the effectiveness  of the example-enriched  Cogntive  Tutor  was  more  efficient  (i.e., students  needed  less  learning  time).  A  problem  that  was observed is that students had great problems in appropriately using  the  example-enriched  tutor.  In  Experiment  2,  we, therefore,  provided  students  with  additional  instructions  on how  to  use  the  tutor.  Results  showed  that  students  in  fact acquired  a  deeper  conceptual  understanding  when  they worked with the example-enriched tutor and they needed less learning  time  than  in  the  standard  tutor.  The  results  are suggestive of ways in which instructional models of problem- solving  and  example-based learning  can  be  fruitfully combined.",

In the second study we use this method to experiment with model granularity.

Whilst it is reasonable to control for the number of students in a sample, doing so for the number of knowl- edge components being aggregated is more difﬁcult because the number of knowledge components still in use tends to decrease as the number of occurrences (i.e. the x-axis) increases. This latter effect arises because some knowledge components will only have been relevant for a small number of student attempts. It is tempting to try to normalise this effect by selecting only those knowledge components that have been used at least n times by all students, and then plot a learning curve that is cut off at x = n. However, this may unwittingly introduce a further bias: only the knowledge components that most commonly occur will be selected, and these may be the simplest. In practice we have found it better to include all knowledge components and try to determine a suitable cut off point for the curve, either by selecting a priori an acceptable reduction in the number of occurrences being aggregated to produce each data point (e.g. 50% of those for x = 1) or by examining the resulting curves and making a judgement call 123 Evaluating and improving adaptive educational systems with learning curves 261 t i f / e p o S l 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 4 Slope/fit versus cutoff point Experimental slope Experimental fit Control slope Control fit 5 6 7 8 9 10 Cutoff Point",

A preliminary evaluation study of the system was performed in October 2002, the results  of  which  show  that  both  problem-solving  performance  and  the  understanding  of  the domain of students who self-explained increased.

The public school is located in a diverse city and has an even  distribution  of  boys  and  girls.  The  classes  are  typical  eighth-grade  physical science  classes,  labeled  neither  “honors”  nor  “remedial.”  Each  online  discussion involves approximately five pairs of students.

To investigate this view, we a) studied how students in engineering and engineers in professional practice solved spatial reasoning problems, b) designed and implemented spatial strategy instruction, and c) characterized the impact of spa- tial instruction on engineering course performance. In the span of 4 years, over 500 students have used our spatial strategy instruction that includes hands-on activities, innovative computer course- ware, and problem-solving assessments. We studied 153 students in an introductory engineering course. Overall, students made sig- nificant progress in spatial reasoning. In addition, gender differ- ences in the ability to generate orthographic projections on the pre-test disappeared on the post-test. Spatial reasoning ability was a significant predictor of overall course grade, and strong spatial skills were necessary for success on the course exams. Spatial strate- gy instruction helps students build a repertoire of approaches for engineering problem solving and contributes to confidence in en- gineering, especially for women. We recommend starting instruc- tion on spatial strategies used by practicing engineers in introduc- tory engineering courses and building on these skills throughout the curriculum.",

A geologic  spatial  ability  test  (GeoSAT) was  developed  and administered  to  115  comprehensive  high-school  students.  Six  of  these  students  were  interviewed.  An analysis of  students’ incorrect answers revealed two types of  answers: (a) nonpenetrative answers, which were based on external exposures of the structure; and (b) penetrative answers, which indicated attempts at representing internal properties of the structure. Students who tended to give penetrative incorrect answers performed  significantly  higher  than  students  who  tended  to  give nonpenetrative  incorrect answers.  The reasoning  of  students  for  these  types  of  answers,  as  determined  by  interviews,  supported  the  initial assumption that these answers were given by students with different levels of ability mentally to penetrate the  image  of  a  structure,  which  was  named  visual  penetration ability  (VPA).  The  interview  findings indicated that the VPA is one of two complementary factors needed to solve the problems of GeoSAT; the other factor  is the  ability  to perceive  the  spatial configuration of  the  structure.  It  is concluded  that  the teaching and learning  process  should provide  students with assistance  in  both of  these areas.",

The analysis demonstrates how the DPD was used by the researchers of the peer-evaluation study in three phases. In the ﬁrst phase, design principles were articulated based on a literature review and contributed to the DPD. In the second phase, a peer-evaluation activity was designed based on these principles, and was enacted and revised in a three-iteration study. In the third phase, lessons learned through these iterations were fed back to the DPD. The analysis indicates that such processes can contribute to collaborative development of design knowledge in a community of the learning sciences.

However, little is known about systems thinking in the context of science education. In the current research, students’ understanding of the rock cycle system after a learning program was characterized, and the effect of a concluding knowledge integration activity on their systems thinking was studied. Answers to an open-ended test were interpreted using a systems thinking continuum, ranging from a completely static view of the system to an understanding of the system’s cyclic nature. A meaningful improvement in students’ views of the rock cycle toward the higher side of the systems thinking continuum was found after the knowledge integration activity. Students became more aware of the dynamic and cyclic nature of the rock cycle, and their ability to construct sequences of processes representing material trans- formation in relatively large chunks signiﬁcantly improved. Success of the knowledge integration activity stresses the importance of postknowledge acquisition activities, which engage students in a dual process of differentiation of their knowledge and reintegration in a systems context. We suggest including such activities in curricula involving systems-based contents, particularly in earth science, in which systems thinking can bring about environmental literacy. (cid:1) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 40: 545–565, 2003 Current earth science education is characterized by a shift toward a systems approach to teaching and curriculum development (Mayer, 2002). Earth science educators call for re- examining the teaching and learning of traditional earth science in the context of many environmental and social issues facing the planet (Fortner & Mayer, 1998). Orion (1998) claimed that systems thinking about the different earth systems, i.e., the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere (including humanity), is fundamental to environmental literacy. He emphasized that understanding the reciprocal relationships within and between each of these systems is necessary for informed decision making concerning environmental issues.",

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT: The work presented builds on a multiyear effort to study the implementa- tion and adaptation of Kids as Global Scientists (KGS), an inquiry-based, technology-rich middle school learning environment enacted simultaneously in hundreds of classrooms across the nation. Two groups of teachers participated in this study. One group consists of “maverick” teachers: those distributed across the nation that ﬁnd us and customize our program to their needs without systematic professional development. This group of teach- ers tends to work in schools with a relatively rich fund of resources and supports. Another group—urban teachers—resulted from a recent partnership between KGS and teachers from a large, high-poverty urban school district. We provide these teachers with targeted pro- fessional development to help them overcome constraints common to their schools. This study provides proﬁles of both maverick and urban teachers, and then examines teacher and student data from ﬁve focus classrooms that were successful in implementing KGS. In all cases, successful classrooms were deﬁned as those where students made signiﬁcant positive gains on open-ended and multiple-choice assessments. The focus classrooms con- sisted of three classrooms from urban teachers in high-poverty environments and two class- rooms from maverick teachers in middle-class suburban environments. The paper discusses the need for research that provides multiple exemplars of classroom science inquiry that are realized through large-scale enactments responsive to diverse learning environments.

        "participants": " PARTICIPANTS, INSTRUMENTS, AND RESEARCH METHODS Program Participants Over the past several years, the KGS program has been utilized by large numbers of schools, students and scientists, as well as increasing numbers of diverse schools. At present, a majority of our school sites are those considered highly diverse, serving populations of greater than 50% minority students, a population that has not commonly experienced high- technology inquiry science programs. More details on how our program has expanded are available in the Results section. In the focus year, the KGS Weather program (Songer et al., 2000) was implemented simultaneously in 230 classroom settings with approximately 230 teachers (some of whom taught multiple classes) and 13,000 fourth–ninth grade students from 40 states. In addition to ethnic diversity, the classroom populations were diverse in type of community setting and Internet reliability. While the largest percentage of classrooms were in urban settings (41%), many schools were located in rural (31%) and suburban (28%) locations. By teacher self-report, Internet reliability was largely unreliable, with 47% of teachers describing their computer reliability as poor and only 18% describing it as very reliable. In this particular program run, then, a diverse group of students and teachers participated. However a common proﬁle of a KGS site was an urban classroom with a high percentage of minority students and poor Internet reliability. The research described in this paper will focus on only a subset of the total KGS partic- ipants. To address questions characterizing maverick and urban teachers, we gathered data from 57 KGS teachers: 17 urban teachers within Detroit Public Schools, and 40 maverick teachers distributed across the United States. Detroit Public Schools (DPS) is a large dis- trict with a population of 96% minority students of which over 70% are eligible for free or reduced lunch. To address questions on the details of student learning and teacher beliefs within focus classrooms, data were collected from seventeen teachers and their students, from which ﬁve classroom groups were chosen for detailed analysis. The students from the ﬁve selected classrooms were chosen both because they were all of the same age (sixth grade) and they demonstrated signiﬁcant content gains from pre- to posttests measuring weather content and inquiry. Because of these demonstrated achievement gains, all ﬁve selected classrooms were deﬁned, for purposes of this study, as “successful.” Of the ﬁve focus groups, two were chosen as representative of successful maverick groups, and three were chosen as representative of successful urban groups.",

Repeated  cycles  of  teacher  inquiry  were  structured  to include: Developing and trying out instructional innovations, documenting classroom experiences, obtaining peer feedback, formulating and discussing questions concerning the classroom experience, and trying out improvements. We found that teachers incorporated diverse perspectives  in tandem with their growing understanding of students’ problem solving:  Initially  adapting  to  different  physics  topics,  then  meeting  students’  diversity,  finally  focusing  the  guidance  of students on revision rather than on the whole problem solving process. The  change  in  teachers'  attitudes  towards  promoting  self-monitoring  by  students  in  physics  problem  solving  was  not straightforward. Although at first it seemed that there was a consensus on goals, and there was just a need to consider means, in the course of implementation teachers gained a deeper sense of relevant issues and decided to re-examine goals. This led to a stronger commitment of the teachers to the workshop goal, which enabled them to dare and take diverse and non-traditional approaches in their classrooms.",

The results from this study will be used to guide the development of cognitive tools to  support  the  provision  of  dynamic  formative  feedback  in  BioWorld.

This  study  focuses  on  reasoning  about situations  that  can  be  modeled  with  general  linear  form  expressions  (c  =  ax  + by).  Formative evaluations of an early general linear form lesson showed that it helped  students  comprehend  the  underlying  problem  situations,  but  was  less successful  in  helping  students  construct  symbolic  models  of  the  situations. These  evaluations  guided  design  of  a  new  tool  to  scaffold  students’ understanding of the componential structure of these symbolic models and the mapping  of  model  components  to  the  problem  situation.    An  empirical evaluation  shows  that  the  new  tool  successfully  helps  students  understand  the structure of these mathematical models and learn to construct them.",

When this theory is appropriately applied in the context of education, students are encouraged to interact with others to construct individual understanding and knowledge. It also provides opportunities for students to reflect on other classmates’ comments, suggestions, presentations, and ways of learning. In the process of online argumentation, students are encouraged to actively write, discuss, and debate online using text-based communication tools. Students make progress in argumentation by providing evidence-based conclusions, describing why they agree or disagree with the presented statements, and try to persuade others.

Although earlier experiments have not always supported this hypothesis, this may be due in part to allowing the tutors to cover different content than the noninteractive instruc- tion. In 7 experiments, we tested the interaction hypothesis under the constraint that (a) all students cov- ered the same content during instruction, (b) the task domain was qualitative physics, (c) the instruction was in natural language as opposed to mathematical or other formal languages, and (d) the instruction conformed with a widely observed pattern in human tutoring: Graesser, Person, and Magliano’s 5-step frame. In the experiments, we compared 2 kinds of human tutoring (spoken and computer mediated) with 2 kinds of natural-language-based computer tutoring (Why2-Atlas and Why2-AutoTutor) and 3 control conditions that involved studying texts. The results depended on whether the students’ prepara- tion matched the content of the instruction. When novices (students who had not taken college physics) studied content that was written for intermediates (students who had taken college physics), then tutorial dialogue was reliably more beneficial than less interactive instruction, with large effect sizes. When novices studied material written for novices or intermediates studied material written for intermediates, then tutorial dialogue was not reliably more effective than the text-based control conditions.",

        "abstract": " Abstract Background: Exposure therapy is effective for phobic anxiety disorders (speciﬁc phobias, agoraphobia, social phobia) and panic disorder. Despite their high prevalence in the community, sufferers often get no treatment or if they do, it is usually after a long delay. This is largely due to the scarcity of healthcare professionals trained in exposure therapy, which is due, in part, to the high cost of training. Traditional teaching methods employed are labour intensive, being based mainly on role-play in small groups with feedback and coaching from experienced trainers. In an attempt to increase knowledge and skills in exposure therapy, there is now some interest in providing relevant teaching as part of pre-registration nurse education. Computers have been developed to teach terminology and simulate clinical scenarios for health professionals, and offer a potentially cost effective alternative to traditional teaching methods. Objective: To test whether student nurses would learn about exposure therapy for phobia/panic as well by computer- aided self-instruction as by face-to-face teaching, and to compare the individual and combined effects of two educational methods, traditional face-to-face teaching comprising a presentation with discussion and questions/answers by a specialist cognitive behaviour nurse therapist, and a computer-aided self-instructional programme based on a self- help programme for patients with phobia/panic called FearFighter, on students’ knowledge, skills and satisfaction. Design: Randomised controlled trial, with a crossover, completed in 2 consecutive days over a period of 4 h per day. Participants: Ninety-two mental health pre-registration nursing students, of mixed gender, age and ethnic origin, with no previous training in cognitive behaviour therapy studying at one UK university. Results: The two teaching methods led to similar improvements in knowledge and skills, and to similar satisfaction, when used alone. Using them in tandem conferred no added beneﬁt. Computer-aided self-instruction was more efﬁcient as it saved teacher preparation and delivery time, and needed no specialist tutor. Conclusion: Computer-aided self-instruction saved almost all preparation time and delivery effort for the expert teacher. When added to past results in medical students, the present results in nurses justify the use of computer-aided self-instruction for learning about exposure therapy and phobia/panic and of research into its value for other areas of health education. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Adobe’s Flash Media Server (FMS) together with its Flash provides an efﬁcient a platform for developing collaborative learning environments.

The collaborative learning environment consists of multi-user collaboration supporting courseware modules called as virtual hydraulic circuits/equipments. In this paper, the Modeler-View- Controller (MVC) architecture designed for the collaborative courseware modules was provided, and key steps of developing such modules using FMS were described. The effect of the courseware modules in helping stu- dents in making preparations for actual experiments was examined, and students’ attitudes toward the modules were surveyed and analyzed. Results showed that collaborative courseware modules can lead to better learning outcome, and efﬁcient communication especially audio communication is more preferred by the tested students. at wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/cae; DOI 10.1002/cae.20425",

The proposed diagnosis agent then scrutinizes each learner’s learning portfolio on e-learning platform and automatically issues feedback messages in case some learner’s behavior that is unﬁtted to his/her learning styles or devious argument on discussion board or wiki is detected. The Moodle, an open-source software e-learning platform, is used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results reveal that the proposed learning style aware diagnosis agent indeed boosts the performance of the learners. (cid:1) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The data and analysis leading to this finding are presented and discussed in this paper. Two groups of students were considered in this research: (1) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida and (2) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Chile. Each group was randomly separated into two subgroups: one subgroup was taught by using the traditional method of linear scheduling (without the use of computer simulation) and the other subgroup was taught by using simulations. At the end of the teaching period, the students in both subgroups answered an objective test-type questionnaire specifically designed to address their understanding of linear scheduling techniques. They were also required, in a more subjective way, to provide their evaluation of the teaching method involved. To assess the effect of incorporating computer simulation in teaching linear scheduling, the students’ evaluations and answers to the questionnaire were statisti- cally compared. The analysis of the responses showed significant differences between the students’ understanding of the subject by using the two teaching methods, with the use of computer simulation shown to be a more effective teaching tool for linear scheduling techniques.

For personal use only; all rights reserved.\fTeaching Linear Scheduling without Computer Simulations (Subgroup 1) The lectures included the previously explained concepts related to linear scheduling and the procedures for developing linear sched- uling charts. In addition, each of these topics was complemented with examples. The concepts were taught by using Microsoft PowerPoint presentations along with some numerical examples. The examples were taught according to the traditional way (i.e., blackboard and chalk); however, some examples were also ex- plained by using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (Fig. 4). Teaching Linear Scheduling with Computer Simulations (Subgroup 2) The simulation-based lectures incorporated the same basic con- cepts related to linear scheduling and the same basic procedures for developing linear scheduling charts. However, concepts of sim- ulation and variability were incorporated into the lectures by using three different software programs: (1) software game “Parade of Trades” (Choo and Tommenlein 1999); (2) Microsoft Excel spread- sheets; and (3) ExtendSim simulation software (ExtendSim 2007). The following is a brief explanation of the ways these programs were used during the lectures: 1. Parade of Trades (Choo and Tommenlein 1999). The objective was to introduce students to the effect of variability on linear schedules (Figs. 5 and 6). After running different scenarios or states in which input conditions are changed to obtain different outputs, the students were able to see the differences between scenarios (those with and those without variability). 2. Microsoft Excel. By using the same examples given to Sub- group 1 (lectures without simulation); the students were able to analyze how variability affects important aspects of the example schedule, such as time of completion of the project, conflicts between activities, and production rates. Fig. 7 shows one of the same examples taught to Subgroup 1 but for Sub- group 2 incorporating simulations. 3. ExtendSim. Continuing the lectures with the same examples the variability was further",

Our Biotechnology, Environment, and Related Issues module, developed within the Science for All framework, is aimed at elevating the level of students’ scientiﬁc and technological literacy and their higher order thinking skills. The research goal was to investigate nonscience major students’ ability to use various thinking skills in analyz- ing environmental and moral conﬂicts presented through case studies in the Biotechnology Module. The research population consisted of about 200 nonscience majors in eight classes of grades 10 – 12 from heterogeneous communities. We found a signiﬁcant improvement in students’ knowledge and understanding and higher order thinking skills at all academic levels. The scores that low academic level students achieved in the knowledge and under- standing category were higher than their high academic level peers’ scores. In the higher order thinking skills—question posing, argumentation, and system thinking—a signiﬁcant difference in favor of the high academic level students was found. The gap that had existed between low and high academic level students narrowed. Most students reported that the biotechnological topics that they had studied were interesting and relevant. Based on these results, we advocate a curriculum that exposes students to scientiﬁc controversies through case studies with environmental and moral implications.

A “lesson study” approach was taken, using constructivist educational theory combined with the variation theory of learning from phenomenography to inform the design of learning activities and to assess their impact. Student difficul- ties with fluid mechanics concepts were assessed using questions from the Fluid Mechanics Concept Inventory (FMCI). Students had the greatest difficulties with pressure measurement, fluid flow through pipes with changing diameter, and velocity profiles for fluid between flat plates. We developed a set of three simulations to address these difficulties. The impact of the simulations was gauged by a second administration of the FMCI. Most of the stu- dents in the sophomore fluid mechanics class participated in the whole of this exercise. Students showed significant improvement in two of the three areas of difficulty. Student feedback on this as an additional learning exercise was very positive.",

J-LATTE supports two modes: concept mode, in which the student designs the program without having to specify contents of statements, and  coding  mode,  in  which  the  student  completes  the  code.  We  present  the  style  of interaction with J-LATTE, its interface, domain model and the student modeling approach. We also report the results of a study we conducted in an introductory programming course. Although we did not have enough participants to obtain statistical significance, the results show very promising trends indicating that students learned the constraints.",

Second, students who received feedback immediately after attempting each problem-solving step outperformed those who received total feedback on near transfer. Finally, students who learned with backward-fading practice pro- duced higher near- and far-transfer scores when feedback included the solution of a similar worked-out problem.

Learning materials on circuit analysis typically rely on equations and schematic diagrams, which are often unfamiliar to non-en- gineering students. The goal of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of the integration of equations into circuit diagrams on the learning of non-engineering undergraduate students. This experimental study compared three integration designs. In the cumulative integrated design, as each practice problem solution progressed, the equations were cumulatively integrated into the circuit diagram. In the stepwise integrated design, only those equations relevant to the present step of the problem were integrated into the circuit diagram; previously dis- played equations were moved to an adjacent frame and recorded there. The nonintegrated design recorded all equations in the adja- cent frame throughout each of the problems. Student learning was measured with a problem-solving near-transfer and far-transfer post-test. Students rated the helpfulness of the diagrams and difﬁculty of the instructional program. Results indicated that participants in the cumulative integrated condition scored sig- niﬁcantly higher on the near-transfer post-test and marginally signiﬁcantly higher on the far-transfer post-test compared to the stepwise and nonintegrated conditions. Findings indicate that circuit analysis instruction for non-engineering students should integrate equations into circuit diagrams in a cumulative fashion so as to avoid the split-attention effect for both the previously dis- played equations as well as the equations for the present problem step.",

        "abstract": " ABSTRACT: A computer support environment (SCI-WISE) for learning and doing science inquiry projects was designed. SCI-WISE incorporates software advisors that give general advice about a skill such as hypothesizing. By giving general advice (rather than step-by- step procedures), the system is intended to help students conduct experiments that are more epistemologically authentic. Also, students using SCI-WISE can select the type of advice the advisors give and when they give advice, as well as modify the advisors’ knowledge bases. The system is based partly on a theoretical framework of levels of agency and goal orientation. This framework assumes that giving students higher levels of agency facilitates higher-level goal orientations (such as mastery or knowledge building as opposed to task completion) that in turn produce higher levels of competence. A study of sixth grade science students was conducted. Students took a pretest questionnaire that measured their goal orientations for science projects and their inquiry skills. The students worked in pairs on an open-ended inquiry project that requires complex reasoning about human memory. The students used one of two versions of SCI-WISE—one that was modiﬁable and one that was not. After ﬁnishing the project, the students took a posttest questionnaire similar to the pretest, and evaluated the version of the system they used. The main results showed that (a) there was no correlation of goal orientation with grade point average, (b) knowledge- oriented students using the modiﬁable version tended to rate SCI-WISE more helpful than task-oriented students, and (c) knowledge-oriented pairs using the nonmodiﬁable version C(cid:176) 2002 Wiley tended to have higher posttest inquiry skills scores than other pair types.

Multiple graphical representations are  powerful  learning  tools  because  they  can  emphasize  complementary  aspects  of  complex learning contents. However, to benefit from multiple graphical representations, students need to engage in a number of learning processes. Educational technologies offer novel opportunities to support these learning processes by making graphical representations interactive and by provid- ing individualized instructional support for students’ interactions with them. Yet, these opportun- ities are under-researched, as most prior research has taken a symbol-systems approach by focus- ing only on multiple representations that use different symbol systems, such as text and one addi- tional graphical representation.",

How do instructional treatments that emphasizes self-explanation affect students’ learning, as compared to other instructional treat- ments? We investigated whether self-explanation can be scaffolded effectively in a classroom environment using a Cognitive Tutor, which is intelligent instructional software that supports guided learning by doing. In two classroom experiments, we found that students who explained their steps during problem-solving practice with a Cognitive Tutor learned with greater understanding compared to students who did not explain steps. The explainers better explained their solutions steps and were more successful on transfer problems. We interpret these results as follows: By engaging in expla- nation, students acquired better-integrated visual and verbal declarative knowledge and acquired less shallow procedural knowledge. The research demonstrates that the beneﬁts of self-explanation can be achieved in a relatively simple computer-based approach that scales well for classroom use. Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

Little research has compared how students learn science from computer simulations with how they learn from direct experience in the real environment on which the simulations are based. This study compared two college classes studying introductory oceanography. One class learned using an interactive computer simulation based on a dynamic, three-dimensional model of physical oceanography. The other class learned by spending a day on a research ship using scientiﬁc tools and instruments to measure physical properties of the ocean directly. In classes preceding and following the simulation or ﬁeld experience, students performed the same exercises regarding currents and salinity, had the same instructor presentations, and did the same homework. The study found that the ﬁeld experience helped contextualize learning for students with little prior experience of the ocean while the simulation made it easier for students to connect what they learned from it to other content they learned in class. These and other ﬁndings shed light on what computer simulations can and cannot help students learn, and what concepts are best learned in the real environment. (cid:1) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

UML is easily the most popular object-oriented modelling technology in current practice. While teaching how to design UML class diagrams, COLLECT-UML also provides feedback on collaboration. Being one of constraint-based tutors, COLLECT-UML represents the domain knowledge as a set of constraints. However, it is the first system to also represent a higher-level skill such as collaboration using the same formalism. We started by developing a single-user ITS that supported students in learning UML class diagrams. The system was evaluated in a real classroom, and the results showed that students’ performance increased significantly. In this paper, we present our experiences in extending the system to provide support for collaboration as well as domain-level support. We describe the architecture, interface and support for collaboration in the new, multi-user system. The effectiveness of the system has been evaluated in two studies. In addition to improved problem-solving skills, the participants both acquired declarative knowledge about effective collaboration and did collaborate more effectively.

Baghaei, et al. empirical findings from different research approaches to define relevant characteristics of a good collaboration, and the authors consider turn-taking as one of those characteristics. According to their results, explicitly handing over a turn can be a good way of compensating for the reduced possibilities to transmit nonverbal information. An implication of providing such a protocol is that deadlocks can be created in cases where one partner cannot proceed with problem-solving alone and at the same time refuses to pass the control over to the other partners. The advantage, however, is that turn taking maintains clear semantics of a participant’s actions and roles in the shared workspace (Dimitracopoulou 2005). The lack of providing turn-taking protocol in most of computer- mediated collaboration tools is considered to be one of the limitations of such tools (Feidas et al. 2001).",

Groups  were  randomly  assigned  to  condi- tions. Only data from consenting students was used in the analysis presented here. Experimental  Manipulation:  This  study  was  run  as  a  3  condition  between  sub- jects  design  in  which  the  APT  agents  provided  some  behaviors  in  common  across conditions,  but  other  behaviors  were  manipulated  experimentally.

It was the micro-scripting behaviors that were manipulated experimen- tally in order to create the three conditions of the design. The first experimental condi- tions was Revoicing, using the behavior described above. The second was the Agree- Disagree condition, where the Agree-Disagree behavior discussed above was used.

We engaged the students to work in pairs during the unit based on research indicating that students appear to learn better, in terms of making more productive and thoughtful comments, when working in pairs in the WISE environment (Slotta & Linn, 2009), and on the nature of model critiquing requiring social context and interaction, both online and face-to-face (Edelson & Reiser, 2006; Kafai, 2006; Schwarz & White, 2005).

The dichotomous key was designed as a scaffolding tool to help students make more detailed observations as they identified various species of birds on display. The dichotomous key was delivered to groups of fifth and seventh graders in two ways: on a mobile platform and by museum educators. Data was collected in the forms of pre- and post-testing and observations to compare the two methods. Findings suggest the Mobile Dichotomous Key (MDK), developed by educators at the Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University, was equally as effective as a teacher (museum educator) in assisting students in a learning activity designed to improve or develop scientific observation skills. While both groups’ outcomes were the same, data from observations made during the learning activity showed that there were significant differences in the experience for the students. Students using the MDK were more engaged, could work at their own pace, and were more likely to work with their peers than students working in groups led by a museum educator. In contrast, students in the educator-led group were able to receive immediate feedback during the learning activity, as museum educators were able to make assessments and answer questions or expand the learning experience. A feedback mechanism is suggested for a future version of the Mobile Dichotomous Key app.",

Centennial Middle School is located on the northeast side of Provo in a more affluent part of town.

Copyright # 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Educators frequently encounter the challenge of choosing appropriate instructional delivery techniques that stimulate the learner’s interest and motivate them to acquire new knowledge. Several choice methods that have traditionally been employed by educators incorporate visual (i.e. text), auditory (i.e. lecture), or dual (i.e. text and lecture) modalities. Historically, computer-based tutoring programmes have lacked affective and motivational characteristics present in human tutors. As a result, such tutoring programmes seek to consolidate different modalities in an effort to facilitate learning. A recent development that seeks to resolve this problem is the introduction of animated pedagogical agents that possess the ability to display lifelike characteristics (Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, & Merrill, 2005; Baylor & Ryu, 2003; Lester, Converse, Kahler, Barlow, Stone, & Bhogal, 1997a; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001). By positioning an animated agent within a multimedia learning environment the agent is able to present instruction in both verbal and non-verbal modes of communication. The current study examined the impact of varying an animated pedagogical agent’s level of embodiment in a learning environment consisting of static or animated multimodal *Correspondence to: Robert K.

Samples and Interventions in Two Experiments For both studies, agent gender, mouth movements, and script length were controlled to eliminate confounding effects. First, the male gender was adopted for all three agents to control for gender effects, given that female (and male) college students have found male agents as more facilitating of learning than female agents (Baylor & Kim, 2003) and also tend to more actively interact with males in other computer environments such as on-line communication (Jeong & Davidson-Shivers, 2003). Second, each  agent  used  an  identical  standardized  matrix  for  its  mouth  movement,  based  on  evidence  that students interpret an agent’s message mostly relying on the shape of its mouth while speaking (Link et al., 2001). Last, although the mentor and expert agents were designed to provide more information than the motivator agent there was no significantly significant difference in the number of ideas conveyed across the three agent conditions.

Several evaluation studies performed with KERMIT and EER-Tutor show that they are effective Intelli- gent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). We also comment on various extensions made to EER- Tutor over the years. There are several contributions of our research, such as develop- ing effective problem-solving support for conceptual database design in terms of interface design. Our database design tutors deal with large solution spaces efficiently by specifying constraints that capture equivalent solution states, and using ideal solutions to capture the semantics of the problem. Instead of requiring a problem solver, the ITS checks whether the student’s database schema is correct by matching it to constraints and the ideal solution. Another contribution of our work is in guidelines for developing effective feedback to the student.",

However,  there  is  concern  that  learning  and  engagement  may  be  at  odds  in  these  game-based  learning environments.  This  view  suggests  that,  on  the  one  hand,  students  interacting  with  a  game-based  learning environment  may  be  engaged  but  unlikely  to  learn,  while  on  the  other  hand,  traditional  learning  technologies may  promote  deep  learning  but  provide  limited  engagement.  This  paper  presents  findings  from  a  study  with human  participants  that  challenges  the  view  that  engagement  and  learning  need  be  opposed.  A  study  was conducted  with  153  middle  school  students  interacting  with  a  narrative-centered  learning  environment.  Rather than  finding  an  oppositional  relationship  between  learning  and  engagement,  the  study  found  a  strong  positive relationship between learning outcomes, in-game problem solving and increased engagement. Furthermore, the relationship  between  learning  outcomes  and  engagement  held  even  when  controlling  for  students’  background knowledge and game-playing experience. Additional analyses revealed that males tended to report significantly greater presence in the virtual environment than girls, and students with more game-playing experience reported significantly  greater  presence  in  the  virtual  environment  than  students  with  minimal  game-playing  experience. Follow up analyses suggested that differences in presence may be more strongly associated with game-playing experience than gender.",

The next logical step was to transfer the entire game on to the computer, thus increasing accessibility to students and allowing for a richer and more accurate simulation of patient scenarios. Methods: First, a general game model was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic. A breast module was then created using 3-D models, radiographs, and pathology and cytology images. The game was further improved by the addition of an animated facilitator, who directs the players via gestures and speech. Thirty-three students played the breast module in a variety of team conﬁgurations. After playing the game, the students completed surveys regarding its value as both an educational tool and as a form of entertainment. 10-question tests were also administered before and after playing the game, as a preliminary investigation into its impact on student learning. Results: After playing the game, mean test scores increased from 6.43 (SEM (cid:1) 0.30) to 7.14 (SEM (cid:1) 0.30; P (cid:2) 0.006). The results of the ﬁve-question survey were extremely positive. Students generally agreed that the game concept has value in increasing general knowledge regarding the subject matter of breast disease and that the idea of following simultaneously the work-up of numerous patients with similar problems is a helpful way to learn a work-up algorithm. Conclusions: Postgame surveys demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our computer game model as a tool for surgical education. The game is an example of problem based learning because it provides students with an initial set of problems and requires them to collect information and reason on their own in order to solve the problems. Individual game modules can be developed to cover material from different diagnostic areas.",

In the poster session that followed in both weeks, groups were encouraged to include results in their posters along with ap- propriate written explanations. The teacher helped participants as needed in both weeks. We analyzed the written and verbal discourse of participants after their ex- periments with balloon hovercraft. This early written discourse comes from what small groups of learners had written on posters in preparation for “poster sessions” where they presented results of balloon hovercraft investigations. We analyzed the written discourse with respect to its form, content, and correctness. Looking at the representative explanations above, we see that Week 3 groups structured their explanations as “if X then Y, because when X then A, when A then B  …  and  when  D  then  Y”.  The  structure  of  explanations  of  Week  1  groups,  on the  other  hand,  varied  from  “since  X  therefore  Y”  to  “X  because  Y,  and  Z”.  We think  the  structure  of  Week  3  explanations  was  better  and  more  similar  across groups because participants modeled it on the cause-linking framework modeled for them in the software. When we look at the content of written discourse, the Week 3 groups used more intermediate causal concepts such as net force and lift force in their explanations than did Week 1 groups. We also see that in Week 1, participants typically provided only one-level explanations. As far as correctness is concerned, groups in Week 3 show more correctness. But we do not believe that Technological support for design based science learning  427 Representative written discourse, early in each week: Week 1 (no software condition) (i) “the larger the air [volume], the longer the hovering time Why? Because the air is the power.” (ii) “The larger the balloon, the longer it hovers and the higher it goes. Why — because there is more air that comes out of the balloon and it goes longer.” (iii) “The smaller the nozzle, the higher the H[over]T[ime]. The larger the nozzle, the higher the H[over]H[eight]. Why: when the air passes through a smaller nozzle, the air is more concentrated & blows at a steadier weight, and air passes through a larger nozzle a bust of air lifts the H[over]C[raft] height.” Week 3 (with software condition) (i) “If hovercraft has a smaller diameter, it will less surface area and a greater hover height. IF: CD diameter decreases THEN: Balloon hovercraft [hover height] increases BECAUSE:WHEN CD diameter decreases THEN lift force increase WHEN lift increases THEN Balloon hove[r height increases]” (ii) “IF: Nozzle Diameter decreases, THEN: Balloon Hovercraft Hovertime increases Because… WHEN: Nozzle diameter decreases THEN [Lift] Force decreases WHEN: Lift force decreases THEN Balloon hover- craft hover time increases” that can be attributed to SHADE alone because the teacher had improved her un- derstanding of the concepts by Week 3. Therefore, we do not take correctness into account in this analysis. Our analysis of verbal discourse from that same poster session shows similar differences. We video taped and analyzed each of the presentations made during that poster session and the discussions that ensued. As can be seen in the typical samples of verbal discourse below, participants in Week 1 offered more impover- ished explanations with respect to science content and focused primarily on the designed  artifact.  The  verbal  discourse  of  participants  in  Week  3,  on  the  other hand, was more sophisticated in form and content and mimicked the explanations that they had articulated using SHADE. Typical Week 1 explanation (no software condition) Student: If I change the size of the balloon it will hover longer. Teacher: … change the“ if ” statement to make it better Student: If I increase the balloon… Teacher: Good, if I increase the balloon size then it will hover longer. Typical Week 3 explanation (with software condition) Student: when the lift force is greater than the gravitational force then the net force will be directed upward, but if the gravitational force is greater than the lift force then the net force will be directed downward and the hovercraft would not move. A fuller analysis of the same data shows that the best Week 1 discourse was equiva- lent to the typical Week 3 discourse and that the best Week 3 discourse was signifi- cantly better than the best Week 1 discourse as depicted below.",

For  complex  tasks,  inexperienced  trainees  clearly benefited  most  from  the  worked  examples  procedure.  When  par- ticipants  became  more  experienced  in  the  domain,  after  two  spe- cifically  designed  training  sessions,  the  advantage  of  a  worked examples  condition  disappeared.  Tuovinen  and  Sweller  (1999) also  found  that  as  learner  experience  increased,  the  advantage  of direct  instruction  over  guided  discovery-based  learning  gradually disappeared. A pattern  may be discerned  in all of these cases.  Inexperienced learners  tended  to  benefit  from  more  guided  direct  instruction. With  more  experienced  learners  or  with  simpler  materials,  the amount  of  guidance  required  decreases.  There  is  evidence  that worked examples are best presented to novices but that they should be  gradually  faded  out  with  increased  knowledge  (see  Atkinson, Derry,  Renkl,  &  Wortham,  2000;  Renkl,  Atkinson,  &  Maier, 2000). At some point, the effect  of guidance may become negative rather than  neutral  or  facilitative.  Because  worked examples  are a form  of  guidance,  we  might  expect  this  pattern  to  hold  when comparing  worked  examples  to  problem  solving. In  this  article,  we  examine  the  role  of  learner  experience  in obtaining the worked example effect.  In all of the previous  studies with  advantages  for  worked  examples  over conventional  problem solving practice (e.g., Carrol,  1994; Cooper & Sweller,  1987; Paas, 1992;  Paas  & Van  Merrienboer,  1994;  Sweller  &  Cooper,  1985; Zhu & Simon,  1987), the participants were inexperienced  learners. When  inexpert  learners  solve  complex  problems,  they  may  expe- rience  a heavy  cognitive  load  which  may  inhibit  learning.  In  this case,  a  sequence  of  worked  examples  may  reduce  the  cognitive load for inexperienced  learners and improve learning more rapidly than  problem  solving  through  means-ends  analysis  by  directly exposing  learners  to  solution  schemas.  In  contrast,  because  of previously  acquired  schemas,  more  experienced  learners  solving various  problems  in  the  domain,  may  not  experience  cognitive overload.  Experienced  learners  may  have  partially  constructed schemas  and  so  may  make  minimal  use  of  means-ends  analysis. Additional  practice  may  facilitate  additional  schematic  develop- ment and schema automation without the cognitive load associated with a means-ends  problem-solving  strategy. In this case, solving many problems may adequately facilitate  further  schema construc- tion  and  automation.  As  a  result,  there  may  be  no  difference between  worked  examples  and  problem  solving  for  these  more experienced  learners.  As  experience  increases  or  the  material  be- comes easier,  at some point,  solving  problems  may be  superior to studying  worked  examples  because  the  worked  examples  have PROBLEM  SOLVING  VERSUS  STUDYING  WORKED  EXAMPLES",

Participants The participants of the study included 224 undergraduate students from an introductory educational computing course at a Midwestern university who were divided into sixteen laboratory sessions. The course learning outcomes consist of (a) having students demonstrate their abilities to use computer systems to enhance their own professional growth and productivity, and (b) to apply computer systems to support instruction in their selected developmental and content areas. The sixteen sessions were randomly assigned to one of three different instructional media tools having 74 students using the GN tool, 93 students using the US tool, and 57 students using the NS tool. We assumed that all participants had similar backgrounds in using instructional technology because the course is taught at an intro- ductory level. Because the class is taught by one instructor and sixteen teaching assistants in each section to run the labs, we also assumed that the students had been exposed to the same instruction throughout the semester. Therefore students from each session were considered equally representative of the entire population of learners in the course. The teaching assistants participated in a training session where all the procedures and protocols were reviewed and explained. This study received institutional review approval and was considered an exempt review. 4.2. Procedures and online tools The three online tools (i.e., GN, US, NS) selected for this study can be classiﬁed as multimedia learning tools that provide visual- and text- based information (the audio is only background music, which is considered incidental to the learning outcomes). Common across all these tools is that each user controls navigation with a computer mouse to access various visual images of objects and text descriptions of the objects, and each tool contains two main components: (a) a set of objects in different sizes and (b) a logarithmic scale indicating the actual size of the object. The three multimedia tools were evaluated by eight expert instructional designers in terms of their potential advantages and disadvantages as described in Magana, Newby, et al. (2012). We present below the description of each multimedia learning tool, the learning strategy embedded in each of them, and a brief summary of the expert evaluation as reported by Magana, Newby, et al.

Thirty-one (N = 31) ﬁrst- to fourth-year pathology and dermatology residents were randomly assigned to one of the two scaffolding conditions. The cases used in this study were selected from the domain of nodular and diffuse dermatitides. Both groups worked with a version of SlideTutor that provided immediate feedback on their actions for 2 h before proceeding to solve cases in either the Considering Alternatives or Playback condition. No immediate feedback was provided on actions performed by participants in the scaffolding mode. Measurements included learning gains (pre-test and post-test), as well as metacognitive performance, including Goodman–Kruskal Gamma correlation, bias, and discrimination. Results showed that participants in both conditions improved signiﬁ- cantly in terms of their diagnostic scores from pre-test to post-test. More importantly, R. Feyzi-Behnagh (cid:2) R.

In science instruction, collaboration  and  knowledge-construction  needs  to  be  done  in  the  language  of  science.  A  collaborative mLearning (CmL) science module employed uses three computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools: wiki, discussion forum and text messaging. This study seeks to determine the forms of communication and learning in the  use  of  these  CMC  tools  in  the  CmL  module.  Twenty  (20)  Form  2  students  of  different  science  abilities participated  in  the  study.  Data  were  collected  from  student  interviews;  online  communications  on  the  wiki, discussion  forums,  and  text  messages;  students  and  researchers’  journal  records;  and  a  survey  of  students’ perception of communication with the CMC tools and learning. The findings showed the learners’ frequency of communication was highest in the wiki and text messaging. The combination of three CMC tools was effective as it catered to learners’ preferred learning styles. Group work and the collaborative activities enabled learning. The CmL module was effective for learning as verified by the improvement in post-test results. The findings of this  study  provide  insights  into  group  interactions  in  a  CmL  environment  and  show  that  peer  interactions scaffold learners in building their knowledge in science.",

In summary, the mobile phone was a personal device which was easily accessible, hence most frequently used.

Several  design  restrictions  on  the  prototype  modules were imposed by the availability of hardware and software when development began in 1991. The program shell was written for Macintosh computers in HyperCard. The initial release of Quicktime, used for movies of the animations and dynamic graphs, limited their display size to quarter-screen. Current compression/decompression hardware and software that  can  overcome  window  size  limitations  were  unavail- able.

This  version  will  use C++ and all digital components to enhance speed, provide cross platform capability, and eliminate the need for an ex- pensive video card.

The present article dis- cusses a study on discovery learning with a computer simulation environment in the physics domain of col- lisions. In the learning environment, which is called Collision, students learned about collisions where two particles move in the same direction and interact via a conservative force in such a way that the total me- chanical energy is conserved. In the experiment we conducted with Collision, we evaluated the effects of adding two different ways to guide students: model progression, in which the model is presented in sepa- rate parts; and assignments, small exercises that the student can choose to do. The effect of providing as- signments and model progression was evaluated by comparing the learning behavior and learning results over  three  experimental  conditions  in  which  different  versions  of  the  simulation  environment  were  pre- sented:  pure  simulation,  simulation  plus  assignments,  and  simulation  plus  model  progression  and  assign- ments. Students’ use of the environment was logged, their subjectively experienced workload was measured on-line, and their learning was assessed using a number of assessment procedures. Providing assignments with the simulation improved students’ performance on one aspect of a so-called intuitive knowledge test. Providing the students with model progression did not have an effect.

In this paper, we have used an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to analyze the effect that intensive scaffolding has on the learning of algebraic word problem solving (AWPS). Two different versions of the ITS, which differ in the amount of scaffolding that they provide, have been created. These two versions were used by two groups of students in Secondary Education, in a quasi-experimental study.

Results come from a macro-analysis of 350 students using AnimalWatch in two different schools during three years. Data from these studies were integrated to analyze the system’s overall effectiveness, as well as gender and cognitive development differences in interactions with the system, particularly in relation to the help component. In general, it was found that students reduced their mistakes as they progressed in the tutoring session, and improved their attitudes towards mathematics after using the system. However, a rigorous study of the internal components of AnimalWatch showed that the system can be further improved to maximize its positive impact. Students saw too many easy problems, and this may explain the fact that they hardly reached the last topics in the vi system. In addition, students benefited differently from alternative kinds of feedback provided, depending on the level of abstraction within the help component and the amount of help. An analysis of help effectiveness for students of different gender and cognitive development showed that girls were more sensitive to amount and structure of help than to level of abstraction in the provided help. On the other hand, boys of low cognitive development were affected by level of abstraction in the help. While boys were being selective about the kinds of help they were willing to see, girls would obediently go through each of the hints provided.",

The ﬁrst agent is responsible for learn- ing a model of how students perform using the tutor in a variety of contexts. The second agent is provided this model of student behavior and a goal specifying the de- sired educational objective. Reinforcement learning is used by this agent to derive a teaching policy that meets the speciﬁed educational goal. Component evaluation studies show each agent performs adequately in isola- tion. We have also conducted an evaluation with ac- tual students of the complete architecture. Results show ADVISOR was successful in learning a teaching policy that met the educational objective provided. Although this set of machine learning agents has been integrated with a speciﬁc intelligent tutor, the general technique could be applied to a broad class of ITS.",

Model-Tracing Tutors (MTTs) are intelligent tutoring systems that have been very successful at aiding student learning, but  have  not  reached  the  level  of performance  of  experienced human  tutors.

Specifically, while MTTs provide hints toward doing the next problem- solving  step,  the  ATM  architecture  adds  the  capability  to  ask  questions  towards  thinking  about  the knowledge  behind  the  next  problem-solving  step.    We  present  a  new  tutor  built  in  ATM,  called  Ms. Lindquist,  which  is  designed  to  carry  on  a  tutorial  dialog  about  algebra  symbolization.  The  difference between ATM and MTT is the separate tutorial model that encodes pedagogical content knowledge in the form  of  different  tutorial  strategies,  which  were  partially  developed  by  observing  an  experienced  human tutor.  Ms. Lindquist has tutored thousands of students at www.AlgerbaTutor.org.  Future work will reveal if Ms. Lindquist is a better tutor because of the addition of her tutorial model.",

In  this  study,  learning  outcomes  of  33  adult volunteers,  who  studied  ‘Introduction  to  Personal  Computing  and  Networking’ courses with CBT and with REDEEM, were compared. Performance of all students improved  from  pre-test  to  post-test  and  was  significantly  better  on  the  course students  had  learnt  with  REDEEM.  Analysis  of  students’  performance  suggested that this REDEEM enhancement was due to the increased interaction that REDEEM promotes. Those students  who learnt most from REDEEM tended to be those  who experienced  REDEEM  first  and  who  required  less  attempts  to  answer  REDEEM’s questions  correctly.

This  was  true  for  learners  in  all  student  categories  and  so  with  all  versions  of REDEEM.  However,  learners  who  engaged  more  with  REDEEM  by  writing  more  notes, spending  longer  interacting  with  REDEEM  and  who  answered  more  questions  correctly first time did learn significantly more. This study appeared to show that enriching and macroadapting CBT with REDEEM does  not  lead  to  improved  learning.  However,  it  is  unclear  if  this  result  was  due  to  the authoring  decisions,  the  Shell’s  interpretation  of  these  decisions,  the  external  courseware used  or  issues  concerning  the  study’s  implementation.

A  normative  ITS  uses  a  Bayesian  network  for  long-term student  modelling  and  decision  theory  to  select  the  next  tutorial  action.  Because  normative theories  are  a  general  framework  for  rational  behaviour,  they  can  be  used  to  both  define  and apply  learning  theories  in  a  rational,  and  therefore  optimal,  way.  This  contrasts  to  the  more traditional approach of using an ad-hoc scheme to implement the learning theory. A key step of the methodology is the induction and the continual adaptation of the Bayesian network student model  from  student  performance  data,  a  step  that  is  distinct  from  other  recent  Bayesian  net approaches in which the network structure and probabilities are either chosen beforehand by an expert, or by efficiency considerations. The methodology is demonstrated by a description and evaluation  of  CAPIT,  a  normative  constraint-based  tutor  for  English  capitalisation  and punctuation. Our evaluation results show that a class using the full normative version of CAPIT learned the domain rules at a faster rate than the class that used a non-normative version of the same system.",

        "abstract": " Abstract—This paper analyzes the educational effects of a peer-learning agent based on pair programming in programming courses. A peer-learning agent system was developed to facilitate the learning of a programming language through the use of pair programming strategies. This system is based on the role of a peer-learning agent from pedagogical and technical aspects and simulates the “tutor” and “tutee.” The peer-learning agent uses artiﬁcial intelligence methods with a Bayesian network as well as teaching and learning methods that simulate pair programming. This paper develops a model for determining students’ program- ming abilities. In addition, the roles of the tutor and tutee are like the roles of a navigator and driver in pair programming. The developed agent system is demonstrated to have positive effects on knowledge retention and transfer in a programming course, with a greater inﬂuence on transfer than on retention. This model combining peer-learning agents with a teaching and learning strategy is more effective in helping learners to acquire programming skills.",

        "abstract": " Abstract Personalized curriculum sequencing is an important research issue for web-based learning systems because no ﬁxed learning paths will be appropriate for all learners. Therefore, many researchers focused on developing e-learning systems with personalized learning mechanisms to assist on-line web-based learning and adaptively provide learning paths in order to promote the learning performance of individual learners. However, most personalized e-learning systems usually neglect to consider if learner ability and the diﬃculty level of the recommended courseware are matched to each other while per- forming personalized learning services. Moreover, the problem of concept continuity of learning paths also needs to be considered while implementing personalized curriculum sequencing because smooth learning paths enhance the linked strength between learning concepts. Generally, inappropriate courseware leads to learner cognitive overload or disorien- tation during learning processes, thus reducing learning performance. Therefore, compared to the freely browsing learning mode without any personalized learning path guidance used in most web-based learning systems, this paper assesses whether the proposed genetic-based personalized e-learning system, which can generate appropriate learning paths accord- ing to the incorrect testing responses of an individual learner in a pre-test, provides beneﬁts in terms of learning perfor- mance promotion while learning. Based on the results of pre-test, the proposed genetic-based personalized e-learning system can conduct personalized curriculum sequencing through simultaneously considering courseware diﬃculty level and the concept continuity of learning paths to support web-based learning. Experimental results indicated that applying the proposed genetic-based personalized e-learning system for web-based learning is superior to the freely browsing learn- ing mode because of high quality and concise learning path for individual learners.
